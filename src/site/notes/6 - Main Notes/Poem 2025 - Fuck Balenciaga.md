[[6 - Main Notes/2025-08 August is Hot but Unemployment is Hell\|2025-08 August is Hot but Unemployment is Hell]]

Fuck Balenciaga I'll kill you're ass in some reebok nanos

Fuck with me I won't need a gun ill take my blade and carve my initals on ur forehead son

I hope you wake up in a gurney with my face as the only thing you can see

Fuck you and what you stand for I eat fascists for brunch I'll swipe at you socialists too ain't nothing more stupid than an anarchist, booooo

Get some better brains so I took yours at the stem I hope you like blood as much as me 

A redneck in the city I'll do all this chuggin coors my man don't even want me sippin
Ready to fight? 
I'm ready for civil war
I know exactly which one of you I need to kill first 

I was born a revolutionaryyy
I'll die in Tennessee

Just remember 
Leave me two coins to cross the river stix
Scatter my ashes where I loved most 
I'm ready to die for what I believe 
And you'll die for a fake ass fraud
