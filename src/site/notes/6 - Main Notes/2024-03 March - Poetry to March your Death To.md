[[6 - Main Notes/2024-04 April - Death March Ends, April is Healing\|2024-04 April - Death March Ends, April is Healing]]

Your light came to visit my sleep   
I felt it at my back,   
Like it was the fear in awe  
I felt it like it was the scripture of my soul  
Scanning, sweeping across  
A primordial part of me knew that light then  
That blue haze light tinged gold  
As remnant from some previous life  
Sweep across the room  
And unto me and unto me and unto me  
You were like ocean waves cresting down  
Again and again, I still look to the window  
To see that light and feel that crashing bliss  
To maybe lift my paralysis outside of dreams  
You are dust, but memories holding you  
Still burn like they were branded into my skin  
I know you'll protect me come sleep  
Thank you for protecting me  
I hope my reincarnation   
Gets another remnant of you 

Your light came to visit my nighterror  
I felt it at my back  
First like the fear in awe  
Holy scripture branded now forever in soul  
Remnants from some previous life  
Translucent and blue and tinged with gold  
Sweep across the room  
And unto me and unto me and unto me  
Over and over, I still look to the window  
To see you and feel that crashing bliss  
That you may lift paralysis outside of dreams  
But all that's left is the burning memories  
And I know you'll protect me come sleep  
But I'll only see you once I'm dust as well  
I hope my next reincarnation  
Gets a remnant of you again

Your light came to visit my night terror  
I felt it at my back first like the fear in awe  
Holy scripture branded now forever in soul  
Remnants from some previous life  
Translucent and blue and tinged with gold  
Sweep across the room and   
Unto me and unto me and unto me  
Ecstasy in a cyclic dread, to this day   
I'll still look to the window to see you  
Your crashing light of bliss  
Hoping it may lift paralysis outside of dreams  
But all that's left is the burning memory  
And I know you'll protect me come sleep  
But I'll only see you once l'm dust as well  
Thank you for watching me even after death,   
I hope my future reincarnations  
Keep this remnant of you, forever, true

I tried other ways bugs  
Everything of concept, feasible or not  
I didn't give in nor up   
I am not faltering, I am living  
Until I'm not  
I ask you, of everyone I've known, when I pass  
To help Mackenzie because he and you  
Are the only two people I need  
To please forgive me… I know, I'm selfish   
Its to you, I need you to understand  
My death was not misfortune  
It was a final mercy

I was such a faithless piece of shit  
A fissure ran down my side  
Making me as hollow  
As my every mistaken belief

I was addicted to addiction  
Took   
Shit nicotine and its tar  
And stimulants and sex  
Over any trade or lasting happiness

There was never peace  
Nor understanding  
Wherever I had tread  
Only the taste of senselessness  
In all its forms  
For I was its agent 

I wanted to die as rule  
With few exceptions  
And when ever I ran out of   
Rope to continue my prolonged  
Bitter self-hanging  
I'd lash on the people  
Who ever regretted   
Giving me any thing

I was the fool  
Not of the world  
I overcome my tower  
Now magician

all my tarot are in reverse? / mom

I was never the fool, mom. I lied. 

Logan was, as above,   
So below. All his tarot cards,   
The World, The Tower, Chariot  
Were reversed. 

He relays to you that he   
Never stood a chance  
Whether male or woman,   
And that he hopes you  
Don't take his self inflicted lynching   
As anything personal. 

Let it be that the right of us is brought into place and the rest of them leveled into plain. Extinguish flames of hate. Douse out the life, even if it be mine, who would dig a shallow grave \- see to it that it is their own grave they've made. If I speak out of turn and should I have any red upon my hands have it be them who returns me to the dust I was born of. May they lacerate themselves on their own knives. Thank you God. 

Its all I can see when I close my eyes  
How long will my body hang in those trees  
What state of decay I might hit   
Or if the buzzards will gore my brains  
Swaying with the winds, I can see   
Even in the span of a blink  
Spiders eating the bugs inhabited in me  
And fungus decay fuzzy and wet  
I fear the return to dirt more than the death  
I wish to skip dirt, incinerate whatever left  
So my ash may become dust again 

I want to swing from a palace of nature my noose around a gnarly black oak  
I can see peace in my glazed over eyes and an end and there will be no more pain

Without volition I will pray and apologize  
Face contorted I'll bargain with wrathful God  
Skip denial, despair is all I've ever known  
In those moments without will my own  
I'll grab the rope and I'll hide it in a rucksack  
And I'll start in haze a walk of finality, of rest  
This will be my peace, so I pick the burnt   
Ruins of what was a palace of trees  
Logged now, only scarce few oaks remained  
I find the most gnarled one and laugh  
It has my face   I lean   
backAnd   begin my endless swing  
All is right once more I   feel Good

Steadily have I stoked this flame so that it's ember hidden deep within still hot chalk  
Will always be threat, must always be in consider  
I have worked tirelessly to make it so,   
Not even a deluge would end me now   
No amount of help enough, for I have stocked just above the tongue lapping at kindles of wood an endless stock of ammunition   
Its contour a crude effigy of my Goddess  
I forget her name  
Any minute now

Steadily have I stoked this flame so that it's ember hidden deep within still hot chalk Will always Be threat, must Always be in consideration  
I have worked tirelessly to make it so Not even A deluge of asbestos Could Stop this stored energy my masterwork magnum opus  
No amount of help enough for I have stocked just above the tongue lapping at kindles of soft wood an endless stock of ammunition a Statue of armaments  
Its shape and form a crude effigy of my Goddess  
I forgot her name…   
Any minute now
