## Written

Font Ideas: 
Nier Lettering, Ariel, YoRHa Logo
	With the halo the weapons have

TENNESSEE SLEEVE: Fireflys. THE SKY.
Witches in the south but a lone girl praying in the middle of a field with flora besides the trees. 
Magnolia tree or flower, somewhere. 
	Broken house next to two story beauty southern style architecture / asymmetrical like the very first draft of  All four seasons? 
OREGON REVERSE: Like that picture from chainsaw man with the astronauts in the ground for the mountains. 


The favorite flowers or my limerent loves. Roses, sunflowers, wildflowers and babies breath. 
	Maybe the babies breath (and even wild flowers) is falling from the rest of the bouquets? It is normally a filler for other flower arrangements.
