Being an artist is three phases. 

1. Gaining the skill to consistently output quality.  
2. Expressing your pain into one work.  
3. Perfecting your style.

It’s more or less in that order. Okay, it’s different for everyone. Some people — me included — have extra, secret steps I’m not at liberty to divulge — go ask an artist friend about their phases to being skilled, it’ll make their day. 

I will say I write strange concept fiction (that nobody wants to publish for some reason) and I vividly remember *thinking* I was at a point of skill where it was time to work on how I write prose and not just improving my overall writing quality. 

I go back to that novel I wrote when I thought that and cringe so hard my teeth grind. I never get past the first chapter. I wish the Eternal Sunshine plot device existed just so I could forget being such a fool. It’s like in middle school when you think you understand how to dress like your friends but you flubbed it and you look like your dad but he’s wearing whatever Nikes were on sale — and people can tell. 

It’s not even the cool Nikes and your writing wasn’t even good enough to think you could move on to the style of your prose. I was at that point. Writers, where are you at? Testify for me here. One week you read Cormac McCarthy and then you were writing without any punctuation, the next week it was Raymond Chandler and no matter what you did the plotline turned into a mystery, then you were reading Haruki Murakami and you couldn’t stop putting wells into your novels as if you had a fetish for them.

There is a well in, I think, every Murakami novel. Somewhere. It’s there. 

It’s a plot device in The Windup Bird Chronicle.

Murakami is like all the best writers. He’s just good. It’s almost like he doesn’t know how to write bad prose, like he couldn’t do it if you put a gun to his head. 

He says one day he was at a baseball game and he was in an in-between part of his life so he was thinking of what he could do next and it came to him like all great things do, like a bolt out of the blue. It said: you can write. So he did and he got published without much effort and I’m not even kidding. He’d never written fiction in his life and he had a thought that he could and… not only could he write, he was so good at it that within a few years it was paying the bills the average 40 something has.

He got better with time, completing step one. Yes, all writers get better, including the impossibly, supernaturally talented ones. Then he completed step two with his book Norwegian Wood. I have a tattoo of the last three sentences of that book. It’s OK, you could say. If you like crying. And it’s never explicitly said by Murakami but it’s agreed that it’s based on his real life. 

What’s the word count so far? Nobody has enough attention span for an essay. 

He hates Norwegian Wood, his best selling book by far. It’s not in his style, it was just what he poured out of his heart and onto a page and when you do that act you don’t want it to be ‘the best thing you wrote.’ It’s about a harrowing part of your existence, it’s not about being good or bad. 

I bet he regrets publishing it. When you expel your pain into art it’s not ‘good,’ it’s… It’s not anything. It just is. And it hijacked the genre and style of writing he wants to be known for.

There is a well in Norwegian Wood near the beginning and it’s oddly haunting. It’s as if he was reading back those first few haunting pages of the book and, encountering where he wrote about the well, becomes inspired. ‘There’s my next book\!’ He probably yells at a baseball game. ‘I’m gonna write a book *about a well\!*’

The Wind Up Bird Chronicles is about a man and a haunted well and once again I am not kidding. The back of the book says it’s about finding his wife but it’s wrong, it’s actually about Murakami’s fetish for wells. The well is almost a main character. The well is more of a lover than the man's wife and I bet the man loves the well more than his wife by the end too. 

But it’s so well written. It drags on, but it’s the drag of a sled in snow. It’s an easy thing to just… forget that 400 pages have flown by with only a few rough patches when you might realize: where the heck is this going? There’s 200 pages left… Where is this going, seriously? And at 100 pages left you’ve got a bad feeling because they still haven’t started wrapping up a single loose end and there are 12 of them.

And it settles none of them. It gives you ‘the realistic’ ending, the one where there is no bow tie, it ends as abruptly as it started. It’s almost meaningless. 

Then another thing occurs to you. It wasn’t that there were ‘rough patches,’ it was that by the end of the first paragraph of certain chapters you had a strong urge to skip it entirely. You knew it was… not really, actually adding to the story on some level. And how could it? This character explicitly doesn’t add to the overarching narrative and on the slim chance this chapter does you read it. To disappointment.

His books have one or more elements of all this. 

I really don’t have the word count for this. People don’t have the attention span for this.

Let’s try to wrap this up.

Everybook, besides one extra, secret one I’m not at liberty to divulge, has shades of this problem.

Besides Norwegian Wood. It doesn’t have any of them but has the very best of all his works. And it’s his soul poured into words, and it could make you cry from the first pages if you're savvy enough to understand where this is going (basically anyone).

Art is supposed to derive meaning from the impossible, what’s impossible to you. That’s why we call it a fantasy, you don’t actually want it to happen to you. Nobody wants to go back to riding dragons and swinging swords like our caveman ancestors. 

And people don’t read Kafka because they want to know what it feels like to be a bug… they do because it makes them feel and think.

When you look at a picture of clocks melting, that can never happen, and neither can this book. It’s the artist’s job to make us come away with something and this book fails miserably in that regard. All the dozen loose ends that don’t resolve don’t make you think of how the melty clock's true meaning is that time is wonky in the modern era — it makes you think of what a waste of time it ultimately was.

That’s not art. I want all my art to make me feel something, anything, and the more visceral the better. He set out with one thing in mind (I think), to be better than Norwegian Wood was to people. And maybe because of that goal is why he couldn’t. It lacks heart.

And because of why The Windup Bird Chronicles fails is exactly the reason you should read Norwegian Wood.

Punchline of the story is this: the fourth step to being immortally great at your craft is realizing you have to put a bit of your heart into every work you make. You make yourself vulnerable when you put your soul into your art — that’s exactly the reason people like it.
