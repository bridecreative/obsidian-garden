#Import 

## `Anywhere can be heaven should you choose to live, 001`

The sun was huge and wobbling over the now perpetual night sky. It seemed to eclipse everything. More than that, it was blood red and tinged the whole solar system in shades of itself. Mars was already red enough. Now it’s fine, sand like dirt that was orange on any day seemed to glow and even the patches of crabgrass that were always a motley green were withering yellow and tinged crimson by our dying sun too.

They seemed to flow down the road and into the valley, an oxygen concentrator slung over their shoulder with a clear medical-grade plastic mask connected, covering most of their face and fogging up at steady intervals. A cloak bellowed out behind and around their arms. It was hard to tell who they were. If it weren’t for their tights pronouncing feminine curves, or that their chest was just raised out enough, anyone would assume them a man. It wasn’t clear at a glance, and seeing their stride like running water or how they held the mask practiced and delicate to their face with their other hand at the hip where a weapon might be only made the stranger more opaque. 

As they stepped down and the valley further surrounds them, they lift off the oxygen mask and try the outside air. Their breath labored now, but seeming to ease. 

“That’s… not right.”

 A man lowers his binoculars inside one of the makeshift concrete structures of the last valley, as he’d begun to call it. He is breathing through his mouth, showing his buck teeth. 

“Dad?” 

The man forgets that he is Dad. He is very far away. 

The kid no older than eight takes the binoculars from limp hands. Little fingers adjust the zoom and focus, bringing the metal to round blue eyes. “You said nobody else would be coming…”

Then the kid is pulled back with such force that his shirt begins to tear. The kid is dizzy from it. He blinks in exaggeration many times. A hand is over his ear and there are muffled yells. All he knows now is that Dad has him around his arms for dear life. Then it is dead silent except for the sound of the one airlock of the eventual two they’ll be using in a few days’ time, opening.

“What did we do,” says the buck-toothed man. It’s not a question. There is conviction in his voice. The kid hears none of this but feels his father’s fear for his own and begins to whimper.

“It’s not like that. Relax with the guns…”

Of the two-dozen people in the building, half of those have some sort of gun or otherwise weapon level and ready for the stranger. Several people take this moment to ensure their safety is off, a shotgun is heard being cocked, there is even one woman pointing a religious object.

The stranger looks behind them at huge orange tanks lining the walls. “I’m standing next to your oxygen supply,” they say. Their voice has no obvious infliction, they are just saying a fact. They don’t follow up. It feels as though they are shrugging, indifferent to the outcome. 

The man with buck teeth notes that those are nitrogen tanks, but that the sentiment is still a valid one. They’ll be as good as dead without them come a weeks’ time. This is minor and fleeting to the one feeling he knows for truth. They’d already be dead if that were the goal. He hates it, but he gestures to lower. He scans the room, quickly, and takes small comfort that not a soul holstered, though without a word they follow his lead.

“Why do you come here?” 

The stranger strolls up to the nearest table, pulling out a stool. They flip out their cloak, uncovering their arms, rolling up sleeves. They look around, as if for any objections, before sitting. They look quite comfortable, somehow. “What brings me here is simple – or perhaps it’s less simple than it is dead serious?” One gets the feeling this isn’t uncommon for them. They shake their head, as if to themselves. “I’ve always wanted to see the end of the world.”

## `I don’t need the sun, 002`

“So. Tell us. Are you man or woman?” 

The stranger wipes away the froth from their mouth. They’re seriously contemplating something. Then their eyes flick, their lips turn slightly for the briefest of moments. It’s almost dramatic. 

“No.” 

The crowd around the stranger roars and howls with laughter. People slapping their knees or any nearby table. Drinks were being spilled without heed. 

So taken, their lost.

“What do you make of this, Bowen?” 

The buck tooth man looks to the much younger woman. He can’t help but feel as though the crowd is around this stranger’s little finger, their every breath baited in anticipation. And that this woman had similarly, but willingly, given herself to him for whatever time they had left.

And he felt bad about it. Took a deep breath, looking back to the crowd around this stranger. “I think if Death did exist, it’d look something like this.” He knew he shouldn’t. She knew she was in good hands, that’s what mattered to her. Safety, he knew that. “That you’d think, yeah, when death comes to visit me, I’ll welcome it with a bullet. But then it does, and it turns out Death is charismatic, and you want nothing more than to have a drink with… them.”

“So, it’s true what they say\!” A man screams over the noise of the two dozen around the stranger’s table. “You can’t get drunk\! Does anything affect you?”

“I’ve heard you are immune to disease, is it true?” 

Everyone wants to hear these answers. It’s all they’ve ever wanted to know, now. You could hear a pin drop. 

“Ask your wives tonight about the voracity of these rumors.” 

And then no man in the room could unsee their point. With laser precision, the crowd made solely of men finds their lover. In turn, every woman scattered across the room threatened death in their glares at the stranger. 

The stranger poured themselves more beer with a pencil smile. 

The men’s interest was already at fever pitch. The stranger couldn’t be more strange, less visible though sitting in front of them, and was quickly ascending to legend in the collective thought. They all started asking questions at once, the conversation now a hundred drowning voices. 

“What did they mean?” Bowen asks.

“I shouldn’t tell you… Fine, just don’t look at me like that, please. Every legionary is born woman, originally.” 

“What do you mean?” 

“She is… she. Not they. Or was. Every woman, no – every girl knows. I’m not sure why. But only women, young girls, really, are ever chosen to use Infernal Machines. It’s not a secret… but…” She starts to fidget with her hair, looking at the ground now. “It’s not a pleasant topic,” she concludes. 

He feels bad for asking. The men’s passion is not dying down, they’re melting. He feels obligated, as he always does, to set things straight. Bowen brings two fingers to his lips and lets out a drawn-out whistle that kills all other voices to murmur. 

“What is your name, stranger?”

“Call me Arthur.”

“Is it true you were born woman?”

“It is\!” 

The riot turns back to a crowd, the mystery solved.
