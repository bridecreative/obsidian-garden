## The Virtues
1. **Love (Agape)** 
	- Agape is a type of love that means absolutely unconditional love, specifically love too.
	- All other ethics flow from this. This is the most important and to be practiced above all
	- *You used agape love to heal yourself when you were without-self.*
2. Sacrifice
	- With love, you can make the sacrifice.


3. Compassion
	- Feel deeply for others. Do not just feel empathy, think of how others feel intellectually. Try to understand their pain from their eyes, in their skin. Always practice that sympathy and never judge others.
4. Justice
	- Defending the poor and oppressed. 
	- With compassion you can make proper justice. When judged with evil in your heart, you make unjust rulings.


5. Humility
	-  Jesus washed his disciples feet. He was not above anyone else, though of course he was.
6. Courage
	- Walked knowingly towards death, which is represented as doing the right thing *under the right circumstance* even if you know itâ€™ll kill you. 


7. Wisdom (Practical)
8. Peace

9. Forgiveness 
10. Hope

11. Faith 
12. Strength
