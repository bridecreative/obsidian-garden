## The Virtues
1. **Love (Agape)** 
	- Agape is a type of love that means absolutely unconditional love, specifically love too.
	- All other ethics flow from this. This is the most important and to be practiced above all
	- *You used agape love to heal yourself when you were without-self.*
2. Sacrifice
	- With love, you can make the sacrifices needed to be done, even at your own and sometimes great expense.


3. Compassion
	- Feel deeply for others. Do not just feel empathy, think of how others feel intellectually. Try to understand their pain from their eyes, in their skin. Always practice that sympathy and never judge others.
4. Justice
	- Defending the poor and oppressed. 
	- With compassion you can make proper justice. When judged with evil in your heart, you make unjust rulings.


5. Humility
	-  Jesus washed his disciples feet. He was not above anyone else, though of course he was.
6. Courage
	- With humility for who you are, putting yourself aside, you easily gain the courage to do what’s right, even in the face of severe punishment.


7. Wisdom (Practical)
	- Practical wisdom isn’t “common sense” but sense from your lived experience that you do know.
8. Peace
	- Using practical wisdom it is easier to understand and find a middle ground for peace from strife.

9. Forgiveness 
10. Hope

11. Faith 
12. Strength
