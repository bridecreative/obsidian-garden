I constantly forget who I am and things I've learned and what I've loved and ultimately the feelings of them. I don't feel anymore, period. So, feelings don't live in me, let's say. And so the memory doesn't ever come out unless it's explicitly brought up. I've been told that emotions are better at holding memories than the actual mental memory is, and that is in fact how trauma is made. Trauma isn't a normal, narrative memory like we have for our day. Trauma is held in emotions and those emotions are held in your body even when you don't feel them. They are so powerful for that reason. It's not recollection, it's reliving. 

My body has rid itself of the ability to feel emotions. I knew this, but if it's to this extent it means that wasn't a side effect... That was the intended effect. You can't relive trauma if you can't feel it. Then it's just a object in your head and not something you survived.
