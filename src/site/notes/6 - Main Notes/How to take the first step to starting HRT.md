The first step to HRT is the hardest step of your journey. And it’s the easiest. I’m not gonna drag this out—the first step is courage. It’s also the last. Courage is the sweet spot between intellect and strength. Yes, Zelda taught you this without knowing. 

So lets say: you see a bear and you decide you’re going to kill it—morality aside, let’s see when your courageous. If you have no weapons at the time, you are all strength no intelligence. 

Intelligence tells us, let sleeping dogs lie. So firstly, you don’t kill bears unless if you have to. So let’s say this bear is next to your camp, it’s a grizzly too so it’s the most likely to attack. Also, it’s late into the season and it hasn’t hibernated yet so it’s most likely to attack anything just for food.

That whole above paragraph is intelligence. You need knowledge of bears in order to make that call, you need the intelligence to apply it to your situation as well. Strength can never tell you anything in that paragraph.

The intellect to start HRT is the same as when you’re going to kill a bear. 
1. You have a good reason to (you have gender dysphoria).
2. The reward outweighs the risk (your quality of life improves so much it’s worth to start).
3. You have the knowledge, besides, to know how to kill a bear (the means to kill it).

So we have the intellect to start HRT. Great. There’s a wealth of information to gain the knowledge to start. You will not have to go to the library and dust off a tomb hidden in the back to find how estrogen affects your body. You can almost figure out how this will work by looking at the opposite genders features. Their fat deposits are in a different location, as well as their muscle. 

Strength… is actually the hardest. It can be summarized as this.
1. Whether or not you actually can kill a bear, you will anyways.

Not that you will try. But that you will. That is strength, the folly that you will do something even if it’s objectively dangerous. Not try. You will.

The middle ground of this is courage.

If you have both of these, and honestly because you are reading an article about how to take the first step, you are missing one or the other in order to pull the trigger.

And it’s probably strength. 

You will make many excuses. You will even use your intelligence to come up with them. Let me give you some options:

1. Start at a low dose.

This seems almost stupid, probably. But it’s not. First of all, it’s better than nothing. It doesn’t have to be balls to the wall. I know this is hard to believe but it’s true. And it will actually help gender dysphoria. Even at the lowest dose it will slowly make changes, it will slowly make you feel better in your body. The changes will be so slow that nobody can tell. It will take 5 years, minimum to see the full changes 1-2mg of estrogen will make, and the full changes won’t be all that much—certainly nothing much compared to taking a full theruptic dose. 

2. Go to a medium dose.

If you have to have more than a low dose to help, that’s fine. If you live in a place where it would put you in risk if you got figured out, what I said about the low dose applies to a medium dose. You just need a plan to be in a safe place by the time changes are becoming obvious. That’ll be about 3 years. You’ll have a 3 year grace period to figure out a living situation that works for you.
