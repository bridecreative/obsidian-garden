It would suck if my Doc ever found this article. I’ll cover my ass real quick: I have never ordered HRT online. I would never. 

There. That should do.

I have had to help people in my community order it for certain, though.

Here’s a problem in the South: not many gender clinics around. I live near a pretty big city in Tennessee and even here there are three or so options. 
1. Go to the huge world renown hospital.
2. Go to a planned parenthood. 

They share the problem that their pretty far away for some people. 1. Has a unique problem to have a near year long waitlist. It’s worth the wait, but it also only takes insurance so… hope, nah, pray you’ve got a full time job. 2. Is prohibitive because if you don’t jump through a few hoops every few months you get instantly cut off from HRT. No refills for you. Their absolutely cutthroat. There is also a wait list for this option though not as long and finally they will only give you estrogen and spironolactone. No exceptions. If this doesn’t work for you your SOL. These are universally agreed to be the worst administration for HRT and, ironically, pill estrogen is by far the most dangerous option available and will give you the worst results, though by how much is debated.

Obviously then some people might want to order HRT meds. You might want a backup stockpile—if planned parenthood cuts you off, if you make an appointment late and you have to wait a month to get in and you can’t refill before your appointment, then it pays off to have a spare bottle. 

The other option is to order only your anti-androgen. Spiro has some pretty shit side effects for a lot of people. It lowers blood pressure namely and if your sensitive to that like I am then it sucks to be on. It lowers my quality of life when simply standing up feels like shit and the only position that doesn’t feel bad is laying down. With low blood pressure, you might not be able to exercise anymore. There is such a overwhelming amount of anecdotal evidence from transwomen saying it makes them put on weight that I don’t care if there is no study on it, it probably makes you put on fat in unflattering places like they all these women agree on.

Obviously then if you’re months out or if your so far away from a clinic that it prohibits you from starting at all you might want to start yourself. Maybe your only option is to start on your own. HRT is exceedingly safe for transwomen. There is evidence that in cis women that taking estrogen can cause bloodclots but there is no study on transwomen. It makes perfect, logical sense that it could happen in cis women when you read that study. It doesn’t make much sense if you’re AMAB and are replacing your hormones—not adding to them—so long as your within safe levels.

You have heard me talk a couple times about studies. I’m well read on every condition I have but HRT studies are the easiest to read… because there are none. This is probably because HRT is so safe to administer that there is no urgency to make a study on it. Why bother if there are no reported deaths or injuries from estrogen’s adverse effects in the trans population? The reality is as long as your within safe blood serum levels there isn’t a real chance you will get an adverse effect. You could get a bloodclot if your over safe levels. Could. This hasn’t happened though. Once. In all these years of people taking hormones.
