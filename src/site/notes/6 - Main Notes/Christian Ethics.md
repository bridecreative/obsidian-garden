## Cut-out

- Forgiveness
- Faith
- Practical Wisdom
- Peace



- **Compassion → Justice**  
    His care for the suffering gave his pursuit of fairness _heart_, making justice not cold law but healing restoration.
- **Humility → Courage**  
    Because he was not ruled by pride, he could face danger and humiliation without fear — his courage was not about ego, but about truth.
- **Love → Sacrifice**  
    His willingness to give his life was only meaningful because it sprang from boundless love; sacrifice without love is just loss.
- **Wisdom → Peace**  
    His insight into the human heart allowed him to offer reconciliation instead of escalating conflict — wisdom channeling peace.
- **Forgiveness → Hope**  
    By forgiving even the gravest wrongs, he kept the door open to new life and change — forgiveness as the seed of hope.
- **Faithfulness (to God) → Strength**  
    Trusting in God’s will gave him the endurance to suffer and persist; his inner strength flowed from his fidelity.
