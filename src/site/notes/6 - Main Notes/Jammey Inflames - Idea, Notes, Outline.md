## Summary

\[NEEDS REWRITTEN/SUMMARY OF PROJECT\]

 {#ü¶ï-misc-//-jot-down}

- Doing something reckless on purpose  
- You destroy the building throwing shade on the Fairyring 

- Arcadia is the Heroic Age continued, the Noble Savage. It‚Äôs inhabited by people living in absolute, resonant harmony alongside nature which they wear like skin, and never undermine. Perhaps the terrorist ‚Äúreturn‚Äù is a bit more extreme than just burning a few buildings‚Äîbut trying for a return to being shepherds living humbly on the land.

NAMES



How God's in the Odyssey favor certain people usually after they've proved themselves, have the same sort of relationship but the ‚Äúgods‚Äù are just ‚Äúmega corporations.‚Äù The USA is Zeus, all mighty. And this is a rebellion against him. What would it take for such a wrathful god?

In that vein, what is the equivalent for a sacrifice to the gods? They ‚Äúpray‚Äù by making messages to them asking for their strength, since you are in a tightly bound contract of loyalty. And, literal contract.

Research how Saints when living spoke to God?

## `THE BIG STUFF.` {#the-big-stuff.}



### `WORLD.` {#world.}

Ideas are bullet points. Fleshed out / certain things are block.

* Sci-Fi tropes(?)

  * Quantum computers as a sub story.

  * 

  **Robots** ‚Äî Of course. AI ‚Äî where is it at? Self replicating robots? Prostitute androids? What part do these take in the story? **Personality** built / modeled after extremely well researched people, E.G. prolific writers, people we know a lot of besides. They make the most ‚Äúcomplete‚Äù life like Doll. Most androids are characteristic of women, and look like one, even if the personality is technically of a male. 


  

  **Dystopian future where the US has migrated to Alaska** after global warming forced it to, fought many wars, and now faces revolution. The world they wish to create is Solarpunk ‚Äî they ultimately wish to make the world better while there is still a world to save.


  **Geometrically oppressing buildings** \- Impressively odd buildings in terms of geography? Like the Las Vegas all-digital sphere thing? A pyramid for lower income people?


  **The Fairyring / analogous to the Slums** ‚Äî Is a little half ‚Äúfairy ring‚Äù of a town. A horseshoe shape of buildings that make a little community. It lives in the shadow of an oppressive building. 

  It is partially in the shadow of a huge, nondescript office building.*You eventually sabotage it, collapsing it.*

  Features ‚Äî Sunken Cargo Compartments in the middle of the ring and expanding below the grounds of it. Called so, because it was basically sea containers sitting some seven feet below the earth. Keeps cool that way. Snow was never a worry‚Äînever got cold enough. Not anymore. James was born and raised in the ‚ÄúNorth-West,‚Äù now she really truely is as North and West as it gets.


  **The Underground** ‚Äî Tunnels like a huge shopping mall connect industrial buildings, tunnels cannot lead to private residences (such as apartments, etc.)


  **The Loc-cal \- Alaska** ‚Äî   
    The Features:

* It never gets completely light or dark depending on time of year\!

* Two Moons to keep the night sky bright, one rock, one artificial. 

  * One is artificial. It‚Äôs entire purpose is to illuminate night, since the world in now nocturnal 

  * Because most people only come out at night‚Äîthe day is too hot, and it‚Äôs too populated for everyone to be out all at the same time.

* Other recreations or transportations or otherwise new D.C. Monuments (?\!)


  Flora ‚Äî The rare pine tree, half dead. Sand pits are like litter, desertification taking control of what was once only lush green.

- *Multicultural*   
- (like portland?)   
- Full of Slavs? Greenlanders? Japanese?   
- What‚Äôs it like? Many different languages being spoken?

* Society:

  * Sucks. 

  * Respect rules‚Äîthere is a lack of mercy.

  * Wholly, fabulously corrupt. For the right price. 

  * *THERE IS A REVOLUTION BREWING(?)*

    * There was a war just before this. Now there is a permanent dictator as ‚Äúpresident.‚Äù

- Other features  
- ***‚ÄúThe Fourth Branch‚Äù***  
  - A literal Hierarchy of class / a caste system.  
  - Megacorporations

    - Otherwise huge wealth disparity

    - Like today, but just exaggerated even more so.

***In dialogue, people talk in blank verse.***

Group 1-2: Introduction as well as continuation. In 2C you have your ‚Äúflashback,‚Äù it‚Äôs everything you need to know about James basically.

#### `Chapter 001.1A.01` {#chapter-001.1a.01}

***PART 1A.01***

\[BACKGROUND\] You do design and coding for huge corporations as a freelancer. You are exceedingly well known within your groups. You also make drugs. You live in the Fairyring. The Fairyring is within the shadow of a huge, unnamed, unmarked office building. 

* You start in the morning, rolling out of bed and showing a somewhat intricate routine. What pills you take, how much, generally what they do (explain in exaggerated manner)  
  * You basically try to ignore this alarming derealization. Get to work. Check your damn email already. You put on a huge headset and settle in for the day.  
    * Now a young man or older boy waltzes in. He is your (ex) step child. You have a kid, too. Had two of them once.  
    * You forgot today is Saturday. You always watch him on this day.  
- ‚ÄúNo offense James, you look like a hot mess.‚Äù   
  He has a black eye.   
- ‚ÄúNone taken. It‚Äôs because I am.   
  ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve seen better looking days too, I reckon.‚Äù

  You have a problem and so does he. He tells you his problem. His house is in chaos and his father is missing. He is your ex-step son, you haven‚Äôt spoken in some time but you two seem to get along fine right away again. 


  - You have a conversation while you skim through email.

  You look to the teen boy who is in your care today. You deliberate your choices. But there is no real choice. You must go and meet him on this. There is no other way about it. If he called upon you in this way, there‚Äôs not an actual choice. So you take the boy with you. 

  \[LINE BREAK\] You describe the place you reside. The sunken compartments. 

* Quietly show the complex ritual to get ready for agoraphobia. Looking up the weather that day, opening the window. Praying on knees, tapping, taking klonopin. Tapping more. Keys to the car that you kiss. Wearing thick gold rimmed aviators.


  ***Part 1A.02 CHILDE PARIS***

  We see in 1A the problem of James and the problem of Paris and now we do tik for tak to try and solve both, or make steps at it. Another wrench is thrown in.

* He needs to check your top secret email.  
  * You check email ‚Äò@neuron.im‚Äô and a name immediately sticks out:   
    ‚ÄúDick McMann‚Äù  
  * You flashback. You were working for someone. They were extravagant, leaving an impression like meeting the devil themselves.

  That is who just emailed you. Dick McMann. The email is simply a link to an NDA. It‚Äôs extensive, no bullshit. That‚Äôs just to begin communication. Since you clicked, you have to respond. It won‚Äôt necessarily still be an offer even in just 16 hours.

* You need to help find his father, but first put his house in temporary order.   
  * To that extent you go and kick his mom out of her slump‚Äìmaybe literally with force. It won‚Äôt really work for good. You reveal that you helped make the drugs she gets high on right now. And you give her an antidote against her will.

*Words so far‚Ä¶   4696*

*Words allotted for Chapter 2‚Ä¶ 	 9,000*

***PART 2C.01***

*Parallel to The Odyssey*

With his father gone, a young man tries to keep order in his house to no success. His mother is inviting strangers who bring ruin to her and her own household, without the father there to enforce any order. This makes James somewhat like Athena. 

What needs to be said in *this* part

* Would probably be a good time to describe the type of world they live in. That you rise with the artificial moon and worship the old rock.   
  * What time of year is it?  
* A good time to open with a dream that foreshadows or tells a story or something but is also highly alarming, such as in the background of the dream there is a mass shooting happening or something.  
* As chapter 2, you need to catch up on what has happened to get this character where they are right now.  
  * You could disguise this by just having the two now-main characters catch up. It‚Äôs already said they haven‚Äôt talked in ‚Äòa few years.‚Äô And implied that, even with that,  
* Must solve the problem with his mother, even if it‚Äôs just a band aid for now.   
  * You give her a hypo of some stuff that‚Äôll keep opioids from working on her for a whole month while shes asleep  
  * You kick some minor ass knocking the wind out of her  
  * You ask at this time where her husband is‚Ä¶ 

1. You lock the door behind you. You pat yourself. You got your gun and messenger bag. You describe the walk up from underground, ‚Äúlight at the top like coming out of the maw of some giant.‚Äù   
2. It‚Äôs winter, so it‚Äôs essentially always night. The one moon of rock is out, you describe it somehow: ‚Äúwith the second, artificial moon coming up on the horizon,‚Äù ‚Äúnight‚Äôs wispy threads of white(?)‚Äù ‚Äúfiltering through the tall golden leaf maples like it was thick.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe whole sky was lit as if in blue hour while the aurora danced overhead with such radiance .‚Äù   
3. ‚ÄúMake yourself useful‚Äù ‚ÄúAuntie, this has only a laptop, tablet, and a shitload of pills.‚Äù ‚ÄúYeah. If you're caught, remember to say it‚Äôs mine then use my name loudly and often after that.‚Äù He laughs. ‚ÄúDad says the same thing. Verbatim. Never used that trick.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou very well might by the end of this.‚Äù  
4. ‚ÄúHow is he?‚Äù ‚Äî ‚ÄúStressed.‚Äù He says nothing else. ‚Äî ‚ÄúAnd you?‚Äù ‚Äî ‚ÄúMe? I guess I‚Äôve been busy growing. And you?‚Äù ‚Äî ‚ÄúRight now you are so much Vale that I could confuse I am talking to him.‚Äù ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not a feeling auntie.‚Äù ‚ÄúNo, Hamlet. But it does contain one.‚Äù

   What needs be said for the *next* part

* How do you find his dad, anyway?   
  * What chapter do you start this? What is the order of things?  
  * Answer: you visit Dick McMann first, then you call his work ‚Äòas his attorney,‚Äô something they somehow cannot disprove ‚Äî you were never taken off as one of his attorneys, seven years ago. They submit and tell you where he is.  
    * Being held by the US Government.

## `ARCHIVE! WARNING.` {#archive!-warning.}

*`James/Jammey ‚ÄúHiatus‚Äù Monikel`* `‚Äî Is transgender. She has PTSD and a mood disorder. Phobia of blue skies. Sometimes she doesn‚Äôt take her meds. Erratic. Obsessive. Type-A. Extreme. Shoot first, ask questions never. Then shoot again. Addicted to pharmaceuticals. ‚Äî ‚Ä¶ James went to law school, decided it was a moral imperative that she get out of that lifestyle after two years oracticing law. Became a private consultant for corporations. Took up Became a frontend website designer. Amongst other things they design.` 

The basic premise is to make The Witcher/Jedi set in a sorta cyberpunk-like Sci Fi future but instead of being fantasy and hunting literal monsters, you're just an Attorney. There is no magic, fantasy, or Jedi powers. Real life has enough of that, you don‚Äôt need to invent the force push. Humans are the real monsters. And you're one of them.

The short stories should be aspects of what this person is, does. The Witcher is sorta part twisted love story, part doing jobs. Part mythos. Part of a play on the fantasy genre itself. 

Parts of plotlines:

* `Revolution`  
* `Trans;`   
  * `Your gay relationships contrasts to limerence with a woman`  
    * `Love triangle`  
* `Being a private investigator that is totally corrupt.`

`USED, DISCARDED`

* `Some-what dystopian / Solar-punk`

  * `The people in this book are trying to make the world a better place. Through eco terrorism. Maybe a revolution is brewing.`

`Outline, Try 1`

`Talk about small little differences. There are cicadas, and locals believe Japanese brought them over‚Äîthough who knows. They‚Äôre as ever present as the dirt, microscopic as sand. Icelandic talk, so common, along with a large Slavic group, and the aforementioned everpresent Asian districts.`

`In summer, you rise with the new moon, it‚Äôs artificial. It goes up as the sun goes down, and that‚Äôs when you crawl out of your borrows in the ground and get to work.`

`Work. And a side job. Get your hands a little dirty helping Eco Terrorists.`

* `- a little ‚Äúmanufactured‚Äù (self sustain) town near Anchorage`   
  `Modeled after your hometown üôÇ`

`(Tentative: New Alaska)`

`Maniacal`

`Stand-alone 01 (out of 06) OUTLINE`

`The team first does a single mission. They explode the plants of some big businesses. But that‚Äôs not the actual goal. You are at the after party for this event. You are with your limerence, a woman named Togame.`

`Work / Foxsec Securities / P.I. ‚Äî Your boss is a total weirdo. Her sense of smell and hearing is super human. Sort of a mentor role. Wavy blonde hair. Defining features, strength. They contract often enough as a third party investigating otherwise-secret internal affairs in corporations. But they‚Äôll take anyone who can pay.`

`Talks at length in her head about the efficiency of whichever drug-of-the-week she‚Äôs on.` 

Chapter 01, Draft 01 ‚ÄúInflames Prelude.‚Äù

Sank Cargo Apartments. Called so, because it was basically sea containers sitting some seven feet below the earth. Keeps cool that way. Snow was never a worry‚Äînever got cold. Not anymore. James was born and raised in the ‚ÄúNorth-West,‚Äù now she really truely is as North-West as it gets.

Just like Athenni being born from the mind of Zues, I too came from a thought. Someone ‚Äî dead now ‚Äî thought ‚Äúmaybe I‚Äôm trans.‚Äù Then a new person came from that. There was a painful, years long metamorphosis. It was as beautiful as it was cruel. When a caterpillar becomes a butterfly they turn into a goo, did you know that? They crystallize. 

I realize I‚Äôm thinking, not talking. I‚Äôm looking deeply into the eyes of someone. Take‚Äôs me a moment. It‚Äôs Togame. Well, that‚Äôs a relief. I hate it when I stare long into the soul of someone I don‚Äôt know well. I think I‚Äôm blinking ‚Äî or maybe trying. Her hand smoothly glides into mine and holds it up in hers and it feels like I could laugh and cry at once at that feeling alone. Her smile, showing her lil‚Äô crows feet, only heightens my intoxication. The contact of our palms and fingers gently nested in each other is better than any sex I‚Äôve ever had.

She‚Äôs a hand holder. It‚Äôs her most enduring trait. She‚Äôs made of enduring traits. I think even the quality of her hair being so black ‚Äî so black it‚Äôs like neon attraction ‚Äî so black as to suck in surrounding light, is enduring too. One time she tried to explain how she makes it shine and flow like it does. I started to get a rare migraine. Maybe that‚Äôs why I obsess over her ‚Äî she is my twisted little project of one part passion two parts incessant need of emotional reciprocation. Our love is as artificial as it is twisted. I doubt she knows. She could. Her huge pupils remind me of river rapids reflecting moonlight. She is a river‚Äîshe flows whereas I‚Äôm rigid. She‚Äôs everything I‚Äôm not. 

There‚Äôs some music that should be loud playing low‚Äîsomebody, here now, made it doubtlessly. String lights of orangish light LEDs banner across the room‚Äôs. Something compels me to scan further. The whole apartment is, basically, a shipping crate that goes on a cargo ship. Thus the moniker for this place is sunken sea compartments. 

But it‚Äôs homely, nicely decorated, lights dimmed just so, and all across the room are various other ultra independent and type-a or otherwise huge radicals, big names of some sort looking into each other with equal zeal and love. It‚Äôs unbelievable. I‚Äôve been to plenty of parties but the atmosphere here is electric beyond words and I‚Äôd give it maybe five minutes at most before some couple starts fornication across some furniture or wall or such.

‚ÄúWill you walk with me?‚Äù It‚Äôs a plea, not a question. It‚Äôs beyond need‚Äîshe might die if she doesn‚Äôt walk right this instant. And I take her hand still in mine and find my footing for us, leading her by the hand out of the room.

The hallway seems inhospitable compared to the lively mood inside. Quite‚Äîtoo. You can hear the sanitary white fluorescent bulbs hum. I quickly make my way upstairs to the borrows opening, where we can make our escape into moonlight. The flight up to the maw feels like it leads to something greater than me, a stairway to heaven, but we do finally emerge in a little hut of a reception room with two automatically locking doors that leads down to the sunken compartments below. Windows are open. The night breeze and warm temperature is the good kind of sweat‚ÄîI feel alive. I open the door to outside.

The new, artificial moon hangs proud and high in this starless spot of the world next to the old, rock moon ‚Äî a waning crescent. The borealis is dancing like two ballerinas tonight. Mom said we didn‚Äôt always rise with the moon.

Togame starts sucking on a little pod‚Äîshe‚Äôs been cradling it in her hand all night. It is a tight black dress kind of night‚Äî ‚ÄúWant some?‚Äù Vapor plums exhale at every syllable. I wish I could get away with wearing dresses like that.

I shake my head. Oddly, I want her lips. I want to tell her ‚Äî forget vapor, let me feel your skin on mine. She would. But that would ruin the delicate emotional reciprocation I tirelessly tend to between us which scares me from saying anything at all.

Chapter 01, Draft 02\.

The morning starts with the usual routine. Suddenly they were asleep then awake. Then there is no more blessid sleep‚Äînot until it‚Äôs due time in the night, according to the routine. The first thing one does when they wake is take 100mg of Modafinil‚Äîit‚Äôs like 600mg of caffeine that lasts for 12 hours and doesn‚Äôt have a crash. ‚ÄúSmart drug,‚Äù they call it. Must be smart to take it. 

The next pills are somewhat smart, too. Ashwagandha, 8000mg. They fumble with bottles leaning over from their bed, dishing out pills. It‚Äôs part of eastern medicine. They‚Äôre not eastern, only medicine, so they don‚Äôt know why it‚Äôs clever‚Äîbut it‚Äôs about as efficient as klonopin, they think. The modafinil gives an adverse histamine effect like having mild arthritis so they take 20mg of zyrtec here as well and wash it all down with a big glass of water always prepared on the nightstand. 

All the other drugs on the small nightstand, so many they nearly pile up in a hoard, are left untouched. They're off the meds again‚Ä¶ Watch out\! They should be taking a plethora of things, mood stabilizers, an atypical antipsychotic, anxiety medicine(s) that don‚Äôt work. They are practically a walking pharmacy, and right now that pharmacy isn‚Äôt serving its one, sole patient.

On the way to the sitting, shining white vanity‚Äîstretches. Nothing so refined as‚Äîaerobics. The crude, warm up kind. Like for a morning jog. 

Sitting. Clearing the throat ‚Äî *ahem*. Brushing wavy auburn brown hair going well below the shoulders. They take a moment to try and appreciate what stares back. It doesn‚Äôt usually work, but they always try. It‚Äôs part of the routine, ‚Äúappreciate yourself.‚Äù Then they stare a bit longer. There‚Äôs something missing.

That face. A hand reaches up in the mirror and it touches where my face should be‚Äîbut I‚Äôm not there, that‚Äôs not me. Is it. Me? 

It is. I go back to the medicine hoard. What the fuck do you even take for this again? Naltrexone‚Äîthat‚Äôs a good start. Impulsivity must be curbed ‚Äî especially when impulses now are mostly about effective ways to harm yourself. They shake out four pills of klonopin and take them dry, even chewing into one and it‚Äôs numbing mint that tastes of relief. Sooner the better with that one. They look at their hands‚Äîat mine. Me. 

I begin to tap with my finger tips rhythmically on the meridians of my skull. The temple, then brow, each time I tap one time more than the last. Tapping the cheek bone, either side, and down the meridians that make up me. Chin, upper lip, down to below the collar bone. Deep breathes. I think with each tap reinforcing as if fingers are the hammer hitting anvil: ‚ÄúI am okay.‚Äù *Even if it‚Äôs not true,* I note, from somewhere nagging. But this truth feels all the better. 

I breathe‚Äîand I can feel it‚Äôs my own breath. A stare, long and cold at a bottle I know holds antipsychotics. I will not touch the bottle, I know. Though‚Äîat this point. I also know I should. I should. I know.

The bottle dissipates and my focus blurs from looking at the bottle as I get deeper into the labyrinth of mirrors that I call my mind. It‚Äôll take days to find my way back out‚ÄîI know this too. I didn‚Äôt stay in dissociate-land long enough to gauge how bad it was exactly‚Äîbut not recognizing your own face. Pretty severe, that‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm scared to check the mirror again. 

Better off getting to work for the day. 

I go past the vanity to another place to sit, this a huge hard wood desk. Looks like it could be oak, in another life. Could have been a hundred things. Now it sits here, huge and heavy and imposing on its space. The wooden equivalent of a rusted out car. I flip open the case of my laptop and press a button indicating power then pass by into the darker spot of my flat, flipping on a light as I walk seamlessly into the kitchen.

Carefully I delegate out enough water and coffee grounds for my expresso. Empty the old into recycling. I take moments here to breathe‚Äîto be present. To feel as my body moves, and it‚Äôs a blessing that it is moving and that I can breathe and be here now. I start to enjoy it, this joyless act. 

This routine. Stick to the routine. 

I bring steaming black coffee back to the nameless artifact of a desk and sit in the opposing, imposing, black Herrman Miller. Typing in username and password, I log on for the day which won‚Äôt be ending for some ten hours. Sometimes the best medicine is to get your head into another space. Especially when the symptom and cause of your concern is just a state of mind.

I open an inconspicuous drawer. It‚Äôs the jackpot. That‚Äôs what I call it‚Äîthis drawer. It is a jackpot for the right person. A plethora of substances, a veritable paraphernalia of them, stare back at me in their little identical plastic baggies and jars. I reach in and fish out a mason jar. It‚Äôs filled to brimming with clear pills of finely grounded greenish gray powder‚Äîpsilocybin. The dose is small‚Äîand that‚Äôs the point. I take one with steaming espresso. 

Adjusting myself into the chair that somehow remembers the shape of me‚Äîthe day starts with checking email. There are two. One is‚Äîemail. The same that‚Äôs been used since forever. The other is self-deleting, everything about it self-destructive and temporary and highly encrypted with the only permanence to it being the actual address itself. 

## `OLD CHAPTERS MASTERLIST.` {#old-chapters-masterlist.}

### `Chapter 1.1` {#chapter-1.1}

The artificial moon hung over Anchorage like a reassuring guardian for a new, nocturnal humanity. The old moon hanging over that, cradling the waxing new in its arms. It was independence day, July 4th.   
The Idiot/Savants are always busy this day, as a matter of course.   
It was minutes before midnight. The temperature had settled at 88 Fahrenheit, where it would stay until it warmed back up to a toasty 200 midday come twelve hours. We were already on site, there wasn‚Äôt another minute to waste.   
I stood and contemplated the truck. It was loaded with magnesium alloys and various other combustibles for a real firework freak show. I went down a mental checklist when someone came up in my peripheral.   
‚ÄúHiatus,‚Äù said a reedy, feminine voice.   
It was Togami. Nobody else would talk to me yet. She‚Äôd gotten me into this Idiot/Savant mess on a purely working relationship. Childhood friend, occasional lover, and likeminded individual.   
I glanced at her. It was amazing how much could change in two years, if only in appearance. A tattoo of a sparrow on her neck, a sleeve of a yellow snake in autumn leaves, and several dermals on her face.   
She took a puff of something like a cigarette that glowed blue light at its tip, exhaling crisp vapor into my face. ‚ÄúAre you about ready?‚Äù She offered the device to me.  
I took a puff and felt a rush of some unknown stimulant. ‚ÄúA pyromaniac is always ready for arson. Let‚Äôs get this over with‚Ä¶‚Äù   
I broke off because it was hitting me. Slightly psychedelic effects, like I was seeing a rainbow form in the fireworks display.   
Not that I‚Äôd ever seen a real rainbow before.   
Togami slapped my back. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôll keep you on your toes.‚Äù   
‚ÄúMore like paranoid‚Ä¶‚Äù I whispered under my breath. But the effects went away as soon as they had come.   
She shrugged, her shadow making a cascade. ‚ÄúSame difference, for our stakes. Follow me.‚Äù   
So I did, not before taking another huff of her narcotics. We walked around the glass building that made one think of what would happen if you threw a rock inside of it.   
Scattering the ground were bodies, some bound in rope and but most strewn on the ground like rag dolls, dark crimson puddles pooling beneath. I peeked behind my shoulder at the fireworks display, one more time‚Äîone could never be certain if they were hearing roman candles or gunshots on this day.   
Togami turned around and walked backward, ahead of me. ‚ÄúAre you even armed, Hiatus?‚Äù She brandished her hand in a fist, which I knew was a battle gauntlet‚Äîa cybernetic glove going to the forearm that enhances innate strength.  
In reply, I flipped open my flight jacket, showing two tomahawks on either side of my shoulders.   
‚ÄúI‚Äôm kinda hoping we run into trouble just so I can see you in battle,‚Äù Togami grinned.  
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nothing you want to see, trust me. Ax-murder is just traumatizing.‚Äù   
‚ÄúAh-ha\! But you can fix that, no?‚Äù Togami said.   
It was the truth, but‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúI plead the fifth.‚Äù   
Togami turned back around as we skirted the outside of this all-glass skyscraper. It was on the other side that we found our destination, an innocuous enough circular platform of metal. We stood on one side as the truck from before rolled up to a stop next to us, also on the platform.   
Togami grabbed a device‚Äînot unlike a phone‚Äîfrom her pocket, pressed a few buttons, then the platform started descending moments later.   
I looked into her blue eyes, not unlike my own, and she raised an eyebrow.   
‚ÄúTell me, Togami, what‚Äôs your philosophy?‚Äù   
‚ÄúYou ask my philosophy, but you really mean I/S‚Äôs?‚Äù  
I nodded. Either one would do.   
‚ÄúHaving second thoughts?‚Äù   
I shrugged. ‚ÄúNot really. I am being paid for this.‚Äù   
‚ÄúI/S is a movement without a goal or set of beliefs, but united on the principle that *change must come* and that we‚Äôll be the ones to force it‚Äîif that‚Äôs what it comes to.‚Äù   
‚ÄúHas diplomacy ever worked?‚Äù I asked.  
‚ÄúNot as far as I know. Then again, I doubt we‚Äôve ever tried.‚Äù   
Most terrorist organizations freely admit exactly that‚Äîtheir terrorists. I/S is a bit different, I‚Äôll admit. Race, gender, ethnicity, background. None of it matters, not so long as they march toward an unclear goal by way of ultraviolence.  
‚ÄúI like to think that these attacks‚Äîthat they set back ‚Äòthe man,‚Äô and if that‚Äôs all we can do then so be it.‚Äù   
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre causing a not small amount of damage to these corporations,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúThe exact impact of it is something you‚Äôll likely never truly know.‚Äù   
Something shifted in my brain as the elevator came to the bottom, subtle yet distinct. I grabbed my forehead and rummaged through the previous moment.  
‚ÄúHiatus, this isn‚Äôt right‚Ä¶‚Äù   
‚ÄúI know, be quiet.‚Äù   
There was only one logical answer as I looked up at a black asphalt wall where the entrance should be.   
‚ÄúTogami, someone shifted us into interstice.‚Äù   
She gasped.   
It was a good reason to gasp.   
We weren‚Äôt expecting one of those types. Which meant a few things, namely that *this operation was expected*.   
Bad news, all around.   
‚ÄúCan‚Äôt you get past it?‚Äù Togami whispered.   
‚ÄúEasily,‚Äù I replied. ‚ÄúJust raise the platform and lower it again. But that means anyone stuck in interstice will *stay* stuck.‚Äù   
‚ÄúHmm‚Äîwhat‚Äôs the other option?‚Äù   
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs asphalt, right?‚Äù I pointed to the wall. ‚ÄúDepending on how thick it is, it‚Äôs gonna be incredibly difficult to destroy. If we use explosives, the platform will also break. We‚Äôre screwed.‚Äù   
‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been had, huh? Well, Boss would say you need to break a few eggs to make an omelet. Let‚Äôs just get past it.‚Äù  
Togami pressed a combination of buttons, the platform raising in response. I felt the shift go back to normal and signaled to go back down as I avoided the trap this time. When we reached the bottom the wall was gone.   
Togami walked in first, and I was close behind.   
Adorned on the ceiling in steady increments were what looked like golden, see through chandeliers of various wires. Known better as quantum computers, a whole server of them. While the incredibly wealthy may be able to afford one, mega-corporations like Shire Electric could afford to have an entire bunker of them.  
‚ÄúGod knows what you could do with this much computer power‚Ä¶ you could probably even predict the future,‚Äù Togami said.   
‚ÄúAnyone tapped into these would be just as omnipresent,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúYou said you weren‚Äôt sure what was down here, right?‚Äù   
‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù Togami said. ‚ÄúOnly the Boss knows, supposedly.‚Äù   
*Where the hell is he, then*‚Ä¶ I thought but kept to myself. Instead, I scanned the area, thankfully nothing was blocking my view.  
‚ÄúSomething is wrong, that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre thinking, right?‚Äù  
I nodded and grabbed a tomahawk from under my jacket, taking aim at one of the chandeliers‚Äîcomputers, I mean.   
The tomahawk bounced right off as if the ax were made of rubber, soundlessly falling to the ground. I went and retrieved it, strapping it back over my shoulder, then turned to Togami.  
‚ÄúWhat the hell is that about?‚Äù she asked.   
‚ÄúIt just means there‚Äôs more than one layer. Being so close to so many quantum computers‚Äîthere could be many, many layers, indeed‚Ä¶‚Äù I turned next to the truck. It was set to follow me automatically, and so it had. I rounded over to the driver's side door and climbed in, rolling down the window.   
‚ÄúYou get shotgun, Togami. No need to hesitate, I‚Äôve got a plan. It‚Äôs perfectly safe‚Ä¶ for us, at least.‚Äù   
I thought I heard her mutter under her breath, but she did as I said and climbed into the passenger seat of the truck. I flipped a switch on the dash, allowing me to control the truck again, and started driving slowly in a circle around the underground.   
‚ÄúCare to explain what you're doing?‚Äù   
‚ÄúI need silence, so no.‚Äù   
What I was doing was in fact looking for a weak spot in interstice, perhaps somewhere I can cut through into the heart of the problem. Sometimes prominent landmarks will be intense enough to grab onto, but since there was virtually nothing inside this bunker there was no chance of that.   
The only chance I had was to run into‚Äîand I mean this literally‚Äîanother person adjacent to us in between spaces *while* trying to cross over. Humans can be conduits in interstice, too.   
We drove up and down the aisles, not going any faster than 10 MPH when I *did* run into something.  
A human I‚Äôd seen before. Part of the crew, now glued to the grill of the truck.  
‚ÄúFuck\! Ah-h-h\!‚Äù The man yelled.  
I stepped on the brakes.   
‚ÄúOh my god\! Tyrus\!‚Äù Togami screeched.   
She jumped out of the car before I could say ‚Äòstop‚Äô‚Ä¶  
I looked ahead. Maybe 20 yards away was a fairy sitting on top of someone's chest, with a hand behind her back‚Äîdoubtlessly holding a knife to their throat. This was probably the person controlling interstice right now, as well.   
Fairys are synthetic humanoids, and not their proper name, but called so because of their light wings that make use of interstice and allow them to make crazy jumps. They all stand around five feet tall, and generally work for their creators‚Äîthat‚Äôs to say Shire Electric.   
I opened the door of the car and looked to the left. Curly blonde hair with reddish bread. ‚ÄúHi, Valentino,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúDid I keep you waiting?‚Äù   
‚ÄúAny longer and we‚Äôd have lost Gibson,‚Äù Valentino replied curtly. ‚ÄúCan you take care of that fairy bitch?‚Äù   
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see why not.‚Äù I shrugged as if it were nothing, but there‚Äôs always something deeply unsettling about astral duels. ‚ÄúYou remember what to do, right?‚Äù   
‚ÄúYeah, I remember. Now go save Gibson.‚Äù   
I took off my shades and put them in my shirt pocket, closing the door to the truck. I walked around to the hood and hopped on, sitting crisscross.   
I took a few deep breaths and put out my arms in front of me, palms out and fingers spread. I closed my eyes.   
As I lowered my arms I imagined another sort of replicant self staying, and separating from me, where my arms had been.   
*Hello, Elliot*.  
I whispered below my breath, ‚ÄúHi again, Izzy.‚Äù   
The second pair of hands fell forward and my vision returned to a new pair of eyes not my own‚Äîthey were my astral selves, a doppelganger made out of interstice.   
My astral body stood. To anyone else, the area surrounding the body would look like a glimmer, or maybe a mirage. To me, looking through the astral body's eyes, I was in a normal body of a woman.   
I approached the fairy sitting on top of Gibson‚ÄîI‚Äôd have run but complex actions like that are difficult in your astral body. You‚Äôd be more likely to trip. She had plenty of time to ready herself, which she promptly did, closing her own eyes.   
Moments later, an androgynous body rose from the fairy, this one only slightly taller than the fairy herself. It was in a yellow dress with a black vinyl hat, otherwise barefoot.   
*Elliot, she must be new to this*, Izzy commentated to me.   
‚ÄúLooks can be deceiving,‚Äù I whispered. ‚ÄúBe careful, nonetheless.‚Äù  
Izzy loves nothing more than going all-out. I could practically hear her whine. But there was another reason to err on the side of careful‚Ä¶ astral duels hurt.   
Besides, any minute now they‚Äôll have a clear shot of that fairy bitch‚Äôs head, and this will all be another page in history.   
I walked over to the androgynous projection and balled my hand into a fist, winding my arm back, twisting the torso, then the follow through and *connecting*.   
The vinyl hat went flying across the room, and I brought my hands back into a defensive position‚Äîbut too late.   
Her foot had already connected with my hip, sending me off balance.   
Getting hit in your astral body isn‚Äôt like getting hit physically. After one connection, certain properties start to affect you depending on a variety of factors. Simply put, shit starts to get *weird*.   
In this instance, it seems like a web has been thrown over me, weighing me down in waves, or maybe seconds is more accurate. I can tell there‚Äôs a timer attached to whatever her power is. My vision gets blurry, but not as blurry as her‚Äôs surely is from my punch. Then it gets sharper.   
It‚Äôs hard to move, hard to move in a kinetic sense. So I make incremental steps back, which is easy enough.   
On a cycle, my vision blurs again briefly, threatening to go black, before I break out of the web again and it sharpens in that cycle.   
This is basic. That fairy really must be new to this.   
A gunshot reverberates through the empty quantum computer room and the opponent's astral self sparkles, before breaking apart into hundreds of infinitely small pieces on the floor.   
I close my astral self's eyes, returning to my own body.   
I let out a sigh‚Ä¶   
‚ÄúAh\!‚Äù I scream, seeing who‚Äôs looking at me so intensely, so closely. ‚ÄúCan I help you, Togami?‚Äù   
‚ÄúYou said Izzy? Who‚Äôs she?‚Äù Togami tilted her head at me.   
‚ÄúSomeone from a long time ago. I might tell you more if you lay the fuck off.‚Äù   
Togami put up her hands and walked away. I jumped off the hood of the car and stretched.   
That wasn‚Äôt exactly enjoyable, nor was it very smooth since I did get hit.   
Valentino walked by me, a large magnum in hand. So he was the one who fired. Makes sense, being captain of this unit and all.   
Gibson pushed off the dead fairy and sat up looking like he was going to hurl. Can‚Äôt say having brain matter that close to you is very comforting, anyway. He rolled away from the stiff and pushed himself off the ground, breathing heavily. You had to wonder why you‚Äôd even bring someone like him.   
Valentino clasped him on the back as he caught his breath. ‚ÄúAre you ready?‚Äù   
‚ÄúY-yeah,‚Äù Gibson stifled out. ‚ÄúI was looking, and this one should be perfect.‚Äù He pointed directly above him.  
‚ÄúHey, Togami,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúWhat the hell are they talking about?‚Äù   
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre stealing a quantum computer, or whatever.‚Äù She shrugged.   
Those fucking idiots. That was never mentioned to me.   
‚ÄúHey, morons\!‚Äù I yelled across the court. ‚ÄúEven if you steal one of those, you‚Äôll never have enough power to run one for more than a microsecond. Let‚Äôs just destroy ‚Äòem all like you planned, okay?‚Äù   
‚ÄúWe might be morons, but we‚Äôre also prodigies,‚Äù Valentino smiled back at me.   
So if they aren‚Äôt idiot/savants they're moron/prodigies. Makes sense. ‚ÄúHow the hell are you even gonna get it out of here?‚Äù I asked.   
‚ÄúIn the flat of your truck. Start unloading the explosives.‚Äù   
‚ÄúI made the explosives so they wouldn‚Äôt have to be moved from the truck. So that if anyone asked questions, there was no truck left to even investigate. Think again, how are you transporting an entire quantum computer?‚Äù   
Valentino clicked his tongue. ‚ÄúFine.‚Äù   
‚ÄúEveryone, get to the elevator\!‚Äù I yelled. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want to be on the same level when this shit goes off.‚Äù 

### `Chapter 02` {#chapter-02}

In the modern age, revolutionary fronts are run on drugs, sex, and rock.   
Around any good front is the music, rockstars with charisma, and their fanatics who listen and are inspired to *change*‚Ä¶ a sort of mass hallucination for the future. For what could be, and not what is.   
We‚Äôve got a good underground scene here, fueling the fire.  
Liberation is centered around freedom of sexuality, not necessarily the act of sex itself, although there‚Äôs quite a bit of that too. When you‚Äôre oppressed for long enough, anything that promises you‚Äôll have the freedom for you and yours is enticing.   
That‚Äôs exactly so here.   
Drugs are drugs, and I make them. Their hardly even contraband in this day and age, long gone are the days of deadly overdoses. I create what might be called designer drugs, drugs created with a specific intent, to fuel the feeling of the zeitgeist of the times. We call it Elixier, you mix it in with a soda pop of your choice, and your chill when all you‚Äôve done all day is deal with transgressions.   
That‚Äôs what we were doing now. Underground, like all houses in this age, is a modest mansion run by the lovely Ferio, a woman as mysterious as she is wealthy, and also a big contributor to our front.   
In the kitchen, I cracked open a sizzling Orange Fanta and took a sip off the top before pouring out a few ounces into the sink. I grabbed an innocuous purple medicine bottle and crack open the seal, carefully pouring four ounces of pink fluid into the drink. Out of my pocket, I grab an orange octagon of stimulant and put that into the one liter as well.  
Putting the cap back on, I gently rock it back and forth before carefully taking off the cap in increments so it doesn‚Äôt fizz over.   
‚ÄúAhh‚Äîthis is the life,‚Äù I say to myself.   
Just before someone barrages into the house. I turn and look over the sound of the music, a ruckus of loud steps leading directly to me as the door is opened with someone's foot.   
They're carrying a child. They place them on the dining table, naked as the day they were born.   
Someone‚Äîsomeone I don‚Äôt know, which is hardly surprising‚Äîfollows with a first aid kit in hand. They place that on the table as well and open up the kit.   
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on?‚Äù I find myself saying.   
‚ÄúAre you a doctor?‚Äù The woman asks, impatience edging her voice.   
I shrug, taking a drink of Elixier. ‚ÄúI might know enough to save a life.‚Äù   
‚ÄúThen get the hell over here\!‚Äù   
I round the corner of the kitchen to the dining area and observe the child‚Äîtheir head is shaved, and they seem to be around 10 or 11 years old if I had to guess. It‚Äôs‚Äîa girl, by the looks of it.   
But there are no open wounds, nor do I see any bleeding. Scars‚Äîthere‚Äôs plenty of those, to be sure, but she‚Äôs not in any sort of critical condition. Her breathing is labored, but her eyes are also closed.   
The man takes out disinfectant, gauze, and bandages.   
‚ÄúWhat are you bandaging?‚Äù I ask.   
‚ÄúDo you not see her bleeding\!‚Äù the woman screams at me. The man's hands are shaking as he rips open a disinfectant wipe.   
Our eyes meet. He‚Äôs dead serious.   
I raise my hands and take a step back, taking another drink of Fanta.   
The man carefully tends to a closed scar on her side, just as if it were actually an open, critical wound.   
I hate to use the voice, the charm, but I see no other way. They‚Äôve somehow fallen under some sort of illusion, and the sooner they break out of it the better. At worst, this could be a horribly elaborate trap.   
I clear my throat, *ahem*, and speak in an ordered voice: ‚Äú*that child is not wounded.*‚Äù The words reverberate as if there‚Äôs an echo.   
They both blink several times, look at me, then back to the child. Their hands stop moving, and the woman clutches her head.   
Charming can be very disorienting and doesn‚Äôt exactly fix any illusions put on them, so they could still be seeing blood.  
‚ÄúTell me what happened,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúLeading up to this.‚Äù   
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre with group black, right?‚Äù The woman said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre what‚Äôs left of group red. We found this child on our mission, and we rescued her. But it seems‚Ä¶ somehow we were duped.‚Äù   
‚ÄúI‚Äôm Hiatus,‚Äù I said.   
‚ÄúCall me Conair,‚Äù the woman pointed at herself with a thumb. ‚ÄúAnd this is Abe.‚Äù  
‚ÄúWhat was group red‚Äôs goal?‚Äù   
‚ÄúEliminating key members of the Shire‚Äôs energy department.‚Äù   
‚ÄúHow‚Äôd you find a girl when you were doing that?‚Äù   
‚ÄúDeep in Shire‚Äôs headquarters‚Äîwe found they were experimenting on humans. As best as I can tell, she was one of those experiments.‚Äù   
I looked at the naked and shivering girl on the table. I had an idea, although it was about as invasive as it gets. I shut it out of my mind for now. ‚ÄúWell, for now, I don‚Äôt think a little girl posses much threat. Find a blanket, or better yet, clothes.‚Äù  
‚ÄúI‚Äôm not exactly good with kids‚Ä¶‚Äù Conair trailed off. I looked to Abe, who shook his head similarly. They were gonna dump this on me? I mean, group red are a bunch of killers, but come on‚Ä¶   
On the other hand, my interest had been piqued by this girl, as my interest is want to do when mysteries are involved. I chugged several ounces of my Elixer. ‚ÄúFine, I‚Äôll take care of it from here. At least until someone more responsible comes along. You wouldn't mind if I probe her with interstice, right?‚Äù   
They both shrugged. Killers to the core. ‚ÄúNice meeting you, Hiatus,‚Äù Conair said, and both her and Abe left from the door they came.   
I turned my attention back to the girl. I saw only one reasonable thing to do in this situation. I took off my shirt, a Palace piece best defined by skate park fashion, and pulled it over the girl's tiny shoulders. It ended up covering most of her body.   
I picked her up in my arms and went to the stairs, a spiral affair complete with a tinted sunroof. By now, the sun was rising. Thanks to the Elixer, I‚Äôd be up for many hours to come.   
Down two flights I came to the bedrooms of this mansion. Only the lowest level, the fourth floor, remained. That was mostly just storage, however. I walked down the left hallway to the back fourth door and rapped on the door.   
*Knock, knock‚Äîknock, knock*.  
A muffled voice from inside, ‚Äúwho is it?‚Äù   
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Elliot and a little girl.‚Äù   
The door creaked open, Togami peeking from behind it. ‚ÄúWhat the fuck?‚Äù the door flung open the rest of the way. ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs the kid?‚Äù   
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what I‚Äôm trying to figure out,‚Äù I said, walking into her room and laying down the child on her bed. ‚ÄúGroup red rescued her, but they don‚Äôt seem to want to have anything to do with her now.‚Äù   
‚ÄúLet me have a look,‚Äù Togami took a seat on the bed and grabbed the child‚Äôs wrist.  
I didn‚Äôt bring her here for no reason‚ÄîTogami is a bit of a nurse, professionally trained even.   
‚ÄúHas she said anything?‚Äù Togami asked. ‚ÄúMumbled something, maybe? Or has she been like this the whole time?‚Äù   
‚ÄúJust like this. Before she was passed on to me, there was an illusion put on the people that found her‚Äîon Conair and Abe. They thought she was bleeding, in some sort of critical condition. I broke it with a charm.‚Äù   
Togami carefully peeled the kid's eyelid back and watched, before doing the same to the other eyelid. ‚ÄúI think‚Ä¶ she‚Äôs in REM sleep. Like, right as we speak.‚Äù Togami looked up at me.   
‚ÄúBut that shouldn‚Äôt be possible, right? That‚Äôs a very light sleep state.‚Äù   
‚ÄúShe could have a sleep disorder causing it. I‚Äôm not certain.‚Äù   
‚ÄúFor now, look at the scars on her body and tell me what they look like to you.‚Äù   
Togami peeled back the gray t-shirt I had put on the girl and carefully looked at the many scars across her chest. I took a sip of Elixier and held onto the nearby wall for support. I‚Äôd drank too much too quickly‚Ä¶   
‚ÄúThey look like medical scars, not the kind of scars you get from being hurt or abused. The kind you get with surgury.‚Äù Togami lowered the shirt, then placed her hands on the girl's head, feeling threw her short hair. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs had surgery on her brain, I think. I can feel the scars.‚Äù   
‚ÄúShe must‚Äôve been some medical guinea pig‚Ä¶ disgusting. Well, is there anything you can deduce?‚Äù   
‚ÄúWell, she‚Äôs not in any physical danger as far as I can tell. But that doesn‚Äôt mean she‚Äôs going to be mentally‚Ä¶ all there.‚Äù   
I nodded several times. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got an idea, if you‚Äôll entertain me.‚Äù   
‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Togami asked.  
‚ÄúSearching her mind.‚Äù   
Togami narrowed her eyes, then looked away. She was against it by instinct, of course. And I wasn‚Äôt going to try and justify it. ‚ÄúSure,‚Äù Togami said after a time. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why you brought her here, right? So I could watch over. Fine, do it.‚Äù   
I stepped up to the bed and took a seat at the bottom edge, Togami at the front. I reached my hand out and closed my eyes. When I opened them again, I was several feet forward in my astral self.   
*Hi, hello, Elliot*, Izzy said.   
‚ÄúIzzy, we‚Äôre going to search her memories,‚Äù I whispered. I doubt even Togami could hear me as I said it.   
My astral arm reached out and grabbed the girl's forehead lightly. And then, in defiance of physical boundaries, the hand and arm sank into the skull. Reality around me warped, taking on the shape of the metaphorical, of the manifestation of psyche. 

I found myself‚Äîor something near enough to ‚Äú*me*‚Äù‚Äîat a shallow pool, standing in a foot of crisp see through running water, able to see with precision every colorful stone and pebble underfoot. There was a sound of a waterfall, although I saw none. It was autumn here, the maple trees all brilliant colors and their brilliant leaves falling with abandon into the slow moving water.   
Perched on top of an island in between the stream was a cause of concern. There was a magnificently elaborate coffin sitting there, its casket open as if inviting me.   
I stepped up from the water onto the island and peered inside. It was empty, although I knew it shouldn‚Äôt be intuitively. *Something* should be there, and the fact that there was *nothing* left me slightly unsettled.   
And I knew it was a coffin for me to fill. That I belonged in there as a wrench belongs in a toolbox.   
I climbed in and laid down, the lid closing on me, and I knew this too to be right and just. It wasn‚Äôt dark in the coffin. It was spacious, and there was plenty to read on the top of the lid‚Ä¶ or so I thought. But all I could read was:   
‚Äú*Yes I said Yes I will Yes*.‚Äù   
I searched around for words, words besides those ones, and found what might be a name. ‚Äú*Bloom*.‚Äù Perhaps that was her name?   
A deluge suddenly hit all around me, no telling where it came from, but I could feel the coffin break free of the sand bar it was once on top of. I was floating through the slow river, and the sound of a waterfall came closer and closer‚Ä¶   
Until I was in freefall for a few moments, and I thought I saw the words change:  
*KILLMEKILLME*  
*KILLMEKILLME*

I found myself in a similar place, but not the same. It was winter, the trees all bare and naked. There was a horrible cold now, especially in the water, now stagnant. Enough to make me shiver and my breath to come out as fog.   
The water was tinged red, and I walked to the place where the coffin might have been before, but the water only got deeper. I kept walking towards *it*, now waist deep in water, wading through. I looked below and saw something prophetic.   
It was the girl, her blood wisping up from several feet below. She was suspended there in the water as if attached to a stretcher. I dove down and grabbed her frail, freezing body back to the surface. Where my hand touched her skin, wisps of vapor like dry ice exposed to sunlight came off.   
She coughed.   
‚ÄúBloom,‚Äù I said. My voice was feminine.   
It must be Izzy‚Äôs body I inhabit in here.   
The girl opened her eyes and mouth, water pouring out of every orifice.   
I waded with her in my arms to the bank, to the dead grass of winter on the embankment. ‚ÄúHow do we get out of here?‚Äù I asked.   
She shook her head. I knew that to mean, ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt.‚Äù  
*KILLMEKILLME*  
*KILLMEKILLME*  
*KILLMEKILLME*  
I got us out of the water and scanned around. Behind the many trees, there was an indent, concave, along the sheer neverending walls of rock. I approached the place, even with fear gripping my stomach.   
Inside the cave, there were shadows dancing about like ballerinas on the walls. They all congregated in a place near the back, shifting and moving but staying most there, leading the way.   
There, stumbling in the dark with the girl in my arms, I ran into a coffin unceremoniously laid on the ground. I could feel the girl shake her head, but I knew this was the way out if there was one at all.   
She‚Äôd been chained in water that was once her paradise, and now on dryland, she‚Äôd either be reborn or she‚Äôd die. I saw no other way. I laid her down in the coffin, and the lid surreptitiously closed shut before me in that deep darkness. I put my back against the coffin and watched the shadows dance before I heard a rumble of the earth above me and rocks fall all around me.   
I closed my eyes. 

When I opened my eyes I forgot where I was. More than that, it seemed I forgot *who I was*. I looked around, seeing a concerned face but no meaning.   
*Elliot, you‚Äôre back. You went into that girl's mind-place*, Izzy said. *You did it, you broke her out of her spell*.   
I felt my face with both hands, the sensation of my own skin like a foreign object. I breathed a deep sigh of relief and laid down on the bed as my breathing increased. I had lost myself in there, lost sight of myself.   
Whoever put that together is one tricky, dastardly son of a bitch.   
‚ÄúShe‚Äôs coming out of it,‚Äù Togami said. ‚ÄúAlmost like she were in a coma.‚Äù   
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not far from the truth, in this case‚Ä¶‚Äù   
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôd you figure out?‚Äù   
‚ÄúSomeone put her in a mind loop. It could‚Äôve triggered on any condition, but I‚Äôd bet it was when she was taken from Shire‚Äôs headquarters. Like a fail-safe.‚Äù   
‚ÄúSounds fucked up.‚Äù   
‚ÄúYou have no fucking idea. Her name is Bloom, by the way. In case I forget.‚Äù   
‚ÄúBloom, please sit‚Äî‚Äù   
I felt a small body cling to my chest for dear life. I looked down, seeing the shaved head of the girl with her arms wrapped around me. ‚ÄúTu su servasti,‚Äù Bloom said.   
‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Äù  
‚ÄúDid she just speak Latin?‚Äù Togami asked.
