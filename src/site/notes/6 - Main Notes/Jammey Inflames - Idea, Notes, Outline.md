## Summary

\[NEEDS REWRITTEN/SUMMARY OF PROJECT\]

 {#🦕-misc-//-jot-down}

- Doing something reckless on purpose  
- You destroy the building throwing shade on the Fairyring 

- Arcadia is the Heroic Age continued, the Noble Savage. It’s inhabited by people living in absolute, resonant harmony alongside nature which they wear like skin, and never undermine. Perhaps the terrorist “return” is a bit more extreme than just burning a few buildings—but trying for a return to being shepherds living humbly on the land.

NAMES



How God's in the Odyssey favor certain people usually after they've proved themselves, have the same sort of relationship but the “gods” are just “mega corporations.” The USA is Zeus, all mighty. And this is a rebellion against him. What would it take for such a wrathful god?

In that vein, what is the equivalent for a sacrifice to the gods? They “pray” by making messages to them asking for their strength, since you are in a tightly bound contract of loyalty. And, literal contract.

Research how Saints when living spoke to God?

## `THE BIG STUFF.` {#the-big-stuff.}



### `WORLD.` {#world.}

Ideas are bullet points. Fleshed out / certain things are block.

* Sci-Fi tropes(?)

  * Quantum computers as a sub story.

  * 

  **Robots** — Of course. AI — where is it at? Self replicating robots? Prostitute androids? What part do these take in the story? **Personality** built / modeled after extremely well researched people, E.G. prolific writers, people we know a lot of besides. They make the most “complete” life like Doll. Most androids are characteristic of women, and look like one, even if the personality is technically of a male. 


  

  **Dystopian future where the US has migrated to Alaska** after global warming forced it to, fought many wars, and now faces revolution. The world they wish to create is Solarpunk — they ultimately wish to make the world better while there is still a world to save.


  **Geometrically oppressing buildings** \- Impressively odd buildings in terms of geography? Like the Las Vegas all-digital sphere thing? A pyramid for lower income people?


  **The Fairyring / analogous to the Slums** — Is a little half “fairy ring” of a town. A horseshoe shape of buildings that make a little community. It lives in the shadow of an oppressive building. 

  It is partially in the shadow of a huge, nondescript office building.*You eventually sabotage it, collapsing it.*

  Features — Sunken Cargo Compartments in the middle of the ring and expanding below the grounds of it. Called so, because it was basically sea containers sitting some seven feet below the earth. Keeps cool that way. Snow was never a worry—never got cold enough. Not anymore. James was born and raised in the “North-West,” now she really truely is as North and West as it gets.


  **The Underground** — Tunnels like a huge shopping mall connect industrial buildings, tunnels cannot lead to private residences (such as apartments, etc.)


  **The Loc-cal \- Alaska** —   
    The Features:

* It never gets completely light or dark depending on time of year\!

* Two Moons to keep the night sky bright, one rock, one artificial. 

  * One is artificial. It’s entire purpose is to illuminate night, since the world in now nocturnal 

  * Because most people only come out at night—the day is too hot, and it’s too populated for everyone to be out all at the same time.

* Other recreations or transportations or otherwise new D.C. Monuments (?\!)


  Flora — The rare pine tree, half dead. Sand pits are like litter, desertification taking control of what was once only lush green.

- *Multicultural*   
- (like portland?)   
- Full of Slavs? Greenlanders? Japanese?   
- What’s it like? Many different languages being spoken?

* Society:

  * Sucks. 

  * Respect rules—there is a lack of mercy.

  * Wholly, fabulously corrupt. For the right price. 

  * *THERE IS A REVOLUTION BREWING(?)*

    * There was a war just before this. Now there is a permanent dictator as “president.”

- Other features  
- ***“The Fourth Branch”***  
  - A literal Hierarchy of class / a caste system.  
  - Megacorporations

    - Otherwise huge wealth disparity

    - Like today, but just exaggerated even more so.

***In dialogue, people talk in blank verse.***

## `CHARACTERS.` {#characters.}

*James/Jammey “Dexicode” Monikel* — Modeled after myself. Is transgender. Has demons, and PTSD, and sleep paralysis demons — and “some sort of mood disorder.” Phobia of dark skies. Sometimes she doesn’t take her meds.   
Traits: Obsessive. Intense. Type-A. Often highly escalating—shoot first, ask questions never. Then shoot again. Addicted to pharmaceuticals. Makes them, too. Or, once did.

BACKGROUND — James started in to law school, decided it was a moral imperative that she get out of that lifestyle after two years practicing law. Became a private consultant for corporations for a few years. Became a frontend website designer after getting too much heat. They make everything they touch look like art.   
GROWING UP — Rose from an almost deplete middle class in California before moving to escape the heat. They weren’t always a good person—not always law abiding, to say.

The Lovers (Eros) — This is the central theme. There is the night chapter, then there is the day chapter that mirrors it.

*Mari “Cross” Yamanashi* — Limerent object to James. Part of the moron/prodigies society. Described as unusually beautiful. Defining feature is pitch black hair, and a snake in the eye that looks somewhat like a cross. Part Japanese, part Greenlander, otherwise mutt. 

*P.I. Vale Anderson* // Wheel of Fortuna— Old friend, became a cop when you went into law. He’s not “corrupt,” but he can be bought for the right price. Makes him worth even more.  
BACKGROUND — You met online through a video game you both used to play as kids. He was from Alaska—moved in with you for a couple years during the law school era to get a foot in the door with opportunities unique to California. Then when things got heated in Cali you moved back with him to Alaska.

*Paris Anderson* —

*moron/prodigies society* — A fabrication. Synthetic terrorism.   
Placeholder.

### `“GODS.” Or; Corporations.` {#“gods.”-or;-corporations.}

To topple the corporations that emit the most Green House Emissions (The Three Sided Zues/God). Instigation of situation: when the US punished only a few select companies to cap their emissions or pay out the ass in penalties. 

*Dick McMann* // Hades (Death) — Representing a Think Tank / Consulting Firm in California… — One of the most powerful men in the world, and you’d never know it. — Who himself is representing CocaCola, one of the corporations heavily taxed by the new emissions law. CocaCola, is, in a word, vindictive. They would start a synthetic war under the name of righteous “eco terrorism.”   
He wears a wig, is huge and imposing—yet, in the strangest way charming. Like his smile alone is magic that’ll open any door.

USA // Zeus (The Tower) — The Deus Ex Machina. Whom chooses the rules of war? The USA.

His daughter \\\\ Pan (The Devil) — Wild, very wild and uncontrollable. Not a good person. Weird, doesn’t wear shoes, very particular. Will be following them around, generally causing chaos.

His son \\\\ Cronus (The Hermit) — The Brains

His secretary // Aphrodite (The Empress)

Group 1-2: Introduction as well as continuation. In 2C you have your “flashback,” it’s everything you need to know about James basically.

#### `Chapter 001.1A.01` {#chapter-001.1a.01}

***PART 1A.01***

\[BACKGROUND\] You do design and coding for huge corporations as a freelancer. You are exceedingly well known within your groups. You also make drugs. You live in the Fairyring. The Fairyring is within the shadow of a huge, unnamed, unmarked office building. 

* You start in the morning, rolling out of bed and showing a somewhat intricate routine. What pills you take, how much, generally what they do (explain in exaggerated manner)  
  * You basically try to ignore this alarming derealization. Get to work. Check your damn email already. You put on a huge headset and settle in for the day.  
    * Now a young man or older boy waltzes in. He is your (ex) step child. You have a kid, too. Had two of them once.  
    * You forgot today is Saturday. You always watch him on this day.  
- “No offense James, you look like a hot mess.”   
  He has a black eye.   
- “None taken. It’s because I am.   
  “You’ve seen better looking days too, I reckon.”

  You have a problem and so does he. He tells you his problem. His house is in chaos and his father is missing. He is your ex-step son, you haven’t spoken in some time but you two seem to get along fine right away again. 


  - You have a conversation while you skim through email.

  You look to the teen boy who is in your care today. You deliberate your choices. But there is no real choice. You must go and meet him on this. There is no other way about it. If he called upon you in this way, there’s not an actual choice. So you take the boy with you. 

  \[LINE BREAK\] You describe the place you reside. The sunken compartments. 

* Quietly show the complex ritual to get ready for agoraphobia. Looking up the weather that day, opening the window. Praying on knees, tapping, taking klonopin. Tapping more. Keys to the car that you kiss. Wearing thick gold rimmed aviators.


  ***Part 1A.02 CHILDE PARIS***

  We see in 1A the problem of James and the problem of Paris and now we do tik for tak to try and solve both, or make steps at it. Another wrench is thrown in.

* He needs to check your top secret email.  
  * You check email ‘@neuron.im’ and a name immediately sticks out:   
    “Dick McMann”  
  * You flashback. You were working for someone. They were extravagant, leaving an impression like meeting the devil themselves.

  That is who just emailed you. Dick McMann. The email is simply a link to an NDA. It’s extensive, no bullshit. That’s just to begin communication. Since you clicked, you have to respond. It won’t necessarily still be an offer even in just 16 hours.

* You need to help find his father, but first put his house in temporary order.   
  * To that extent you go and kick his mom out of her slump–maybe literally with force. It won’t really work for good. You reveal that you helped make the drugs she gets high on right now. And you give her an antidote against her will.

		*Words so far….	4696*

#### `Chapter 002`  {#chapter-002}

*Words so far…   4696*

*Words allotted for Chapter 2… 	 9,000*

***PART 2C.01***

*Parallel to The Odyssey*

With his father gone, a young man tries to keep order in his house to no success. His mother is inviting strangers who bring ruin to her and her own household, without the father there to enforce any order. This makes James somewhat like Athena. 

What needs to be said in *this* part

* Would probably be a good time to describe the type of world they live in. That you rise with the artificial moon and worship the old rock.   
  * What time of year is it?  
* A good time to open with a dream that foreshadows or tells a story or something but is also highly alarming, such as in the background of the dream there is a mass shooting happening or something.  
* As chapter 2, you need to catch up on what has happened to get this character where they are right now.  
  * You could disguise this by just having the two now-main characters catch up. It’s already said they haven’t talked in ‘a few years.’ And implied that, even with that,  
* Must solve the problem with his mother, even if it’s just a band aid for now.   
  * You give her a hypo of some stuff that’ll keep opioids from working on her for a whole month while shes asleep  
  * You kick some minor ass knocking the wind out of her  
  * You ask at this time where her husband is… 

1. You lock the door behind you. You pat yourself. You got your gun and messenger bag. You describe the walk up from underground, “light at the top like coming out of the maw of some giant.”   
2. It’s winter, so it’s essentially always night. The one moon of rock is out, you describe it somehow: “with the second, artificial moon coming up on the horizon,” “night’s wispy threads of white(?)” “filtering through the tall golden leaf maples like it was thick.” “The whole sky was lit as if in blue hour while the aurora danced overhead with such radiance .”   
3. “Make yourself useful” “Auntie, this has only a laptop, tablet, and a shitload of pills.” “Yeah. If you're caught, remember to say it’s mine then use my name loudly and often after that.” He laughs. “Dad says the same thing. Verbatim. Never used that trick.” “You very well might by the end of this.”  
4. “How is he?” — “Stressed.” He says nothing else. — “And you?” — “Me? I guess I’ve been busy growing. And you?” — “Right now you are so much Vale that I could confuse I am talking to him.” “That’s not a feeling auntie.” “No, Hamlet. But it does contain one.”

   What needs be said for the *next* part

* How do you find his dad, anyway?   
  * What chapter do you start this? What is the order of things?  
  * Answer: you visit Dick McMann first, then you call his work ‘as his attorney,’ something they somehow cannot disprove — you were never taken off as one of his attorneys, seven years ago. They submit and tell you where he is.  
    * Being held by the US Government.

## `ARCHIVE! WARNING.` {#archive!-warning.}

*`James/Jammey “Hiatus” Monikel`* `— Is transgender. She has PTSD and a mood disorder. Phobia of blue skies. Sometimes she doesn’t take her meds. Erratic. Obsessive. Type-A. Extreme. Shoot first, ask questions never. Then shoot again. Addicted to pharmaceuticals. — … James went to law school, decided it was a moral imperative that she get out of that lifestyle after two years oracticing law. Became a private consultant for corporations. Took up Became a frontend website designer. Amongst other things they design.` 

The basic premise is to make The Witcher/Jedi set in a sorta cyberpunk-like Sci Fi future but instead of being fantasy and hunting literal monsters, you're just an Attorney. There is no magic, fantasy, or Jedi powers. Real life has enough of that, you don’t need to invent the force push. Humans are the real monsters. And you're one of them.

The short stories should be aspects of what this person is, does. The Witcher is sorta part twisted love story, part doing jobs. Part mythos. Part of a play on the fantasy genre itself. 

Parts of plotlines:

* `Revolution`  
* `Trans;`   
  * `Your gay relationships contrasts to limerence with a woman`  
    * `Love triangle`  
* `Being a private investigator that is totally corrupt.`

`USED, DISCARDED`

* `Some-what dystopian / Solar-punk`

  * `The people in this book are trying to make the world a better place. Through eco terrorism. Maybe a revolution is brewing.`

`Outline, Try 1`

`Talk about small little differences. There are cicadas, and locals believe Japanese brought them over—though who knows. They’re as ever present as the dirt, microscopic as sand. Icelandic talk, so common, along with a large Slavic group, and the aforementioned everpresent Asian districts.`

`In summer, you rise with the new moon, it’s artificial. It goes up as the sun goes down, and that’s when you crawl out of your borrows in the ground and get to work.`

`Work. And a side job. Get your hands a little dirty helping Eco Terrorists.`

* `- a little “manufactured” (self sustain) town near Anchorage`   
  `Modeled after your hometown 🙂`

`(Tentative: New Alaska)`

`Maniacal`

`Stand-alone 01 (out of 06) OUTLINE`

`The team first does a single mission. They explode the plants of some big businesses. But that’s not the actual goal. You are at the after party for this event. You are with your limerence, a woman named Togame.`

`Work / Foxsec Securities / P.I. — Your boss is a total weirdo. Her sense of smell and hearing is super human. Sort of a mentor role. Wavy blonde hair. Defining features, strength. They contract often enough as a third party investigating otherwise-secret internal affairs in corporations. But they’ll take anyone who can pay.`

`Talks at length in her head about the efficiency of whichever drug-of-the-week she’s on.` 

Chapter 01, Draft 01 “Inflames Prelude.”

Sank Cargo Apartments. Called so, because it was basically sea containers sitting some seven feet below the earth. Keeps cool that way. Snow was never a worry—never got cold. Not anymore. James was born and raised in the “North-West,” now she really truely is as North-West as it gets.

Just like Athenni being born from the mind of Zues, I too came from a thought. Someone — dead now — thought “maybe I’m trans.” Then a new person came from that. There was a painful, years long metamorphosis. It was as beautiful as it was cruel. When a caterpillar becomes a butterfly they turn into a goo, did you know that? They crystallize. 

I realize I’m thinking, not talking. I’m looking deeply into the eyes of someone. Take’s me a moment. It’s Togame. Well, that’s a relief. I hate it when I stare long into the soul of someone I don’t know well. I think I’m blinking — or maybe trying. Her hand smoothly glides into mine and holds it up in hers and it feels like I could laugh and cry at once at that feeling alone. Her smile, showing her lil’ crows feet, only heightens my intoxication. The contact of our palms and fingers gently nested in each other is better than any sex I’ve ever had.

She’s a hand holder. It’s her most enduring trait. She’s made of enduring traits. I think even the quality of her hair being so black — so black it’s like neon attraction — so black as to suck in surrounding light, is enduring too. One time she tried to explain how she makes it shine and flow like it does. I started to get a rare migraine. Maybe that’s why I obsess over her — she is my twisted little project of one part passion two parts incessant need of emotional reciprocation. Our love is as artificial as it is twisted. I doubt she knows. She could. Her huge pupils remind me of river rapids reflecting moonlight. She is a river—she flows whereas I’m rigid. She’s everything I’m not. 

There’s some music that should be loud playing low—somebody, here now, made it doubtlessly. String lights of orangish light LEDs banner across the room’s. Something compels me to scan further. The whole apartment is, basically, a shipping crate that goes on a cargo ship. Thus the moniker for this place is sunken sea compartments. 

But it’s homely, nicely decorated, lights dimmed just so, and all across the room are various other ultra independent and type-a or otherwise huge radicals, big names of some sort looking into each other with equal zeal and love. It’s unbelievable. I’ve been to plenty of parties but the atmosphere here is electric beyond words and I’d give it maybe five minutes at most before some couple starts fornication across some furniture or wall or such.

“Will you walk with me?” It’s a plea, not a question. It’s beyond need—she might die if she doesn’t walk right this instant. And I take her hand still in mine and find my footing for us, leading her by the hand out of the room.

The hallway seems inhospitable compared to the lively mood inside. Quite—too. You can hear the sanitary white fluorescent bulbs hum. I quickly make my way upstairs to the borrows opening, where we can make our escape into moonlight. The flight up to the maw feels like it leads to something greater than me, a stairway to heaven, but we do finally emerge in a little hut of a reception room with two automatically locking doors that leads down to the sunken compartments below. Windows are open. The night breeze and warm temperature is the good kind of sweat—I feel alive. I open the door to outside.

The new, artificial moon hangs proud and high in this starless spot of the world next to the old, rock moon — a waning crescent. The borealis is dancing like two ballerinas tonight. Mom said we didn’t always rise with the moon.

Togame starts sucking on a little pod—she’s been cradling it in her hand all night. It is a tight black dress kind of night— “Want some?” Vapor plums exhale at every syllable. I wish I could get away with wearing dresses like that.

I shake my head. Oddly, I want her lips. I want to tell her — forget vapor, let me feel your skin on mine. She would. But that would ruin the delicate emotional reciprocation I tirelessly tend to between us which scares me from saying anything at all.

Chapter 01, Draft 02\.

The morning starts with the usual routine. Suddenly they were asleep then awake. Then there is no more blessid sleep—not until it’s due time in the night, according to the routine. The first thing one does when they wake is take 100mg of Modafinil—it’s like 600mg of caffeine that lasts for 12 hours and doesn’t have a crash. “Smart drug,” they call it. Must be smart to take it. 

The next pills are somewhat smart, too. Ashwagandha, 8000mg. They fumble with bottles leaning over from their bed, dishing out pills. It’s part of eastern medicine. They’re not eastern, only medicine, so they don’t know why it’s clever—but it’s about as efficient as klonopin, they think. The modafinil gives an adverse histamine effect like having mild arthritis so they take 20mg of zyrtec here as well and wash it all down with a big glass of water always prepared on the nightstand. 

All the other drugs on the small nightstand, so many they nearly pile up in a hoard, are left untouched. They're off the meds again… Watch out\! They should be taking a plethora of things, mood stabilizers, an atypical antipsychotic, anxiety medicine(s) that don’t work. They are practically a walking pharmacy, and right now that pharmacy isn’t serving its one, sole patient.

On the way to the sitting, shining white vanity—stretches. Nothing so refined as—aerobics. The crude, warm up kind. Like for a morning jog. 

Sitting. Clearing the throat — *ahem*. Brushing wavy auburn brown hair going well below the shoulders. They take a moment to try and appreciate what stares back. It doesn’t usually work, but they always try. It’s part of the routine, “appreciate yourself.” Then they stare a bit longer. There’s something missing.

That face. A hand reaches up in the mirror and it touches where my face should be—but I’m not there, that’s not me. Is it. Me? 

It is. I go back to the medicine hoard. What the fuck do you even take for this again? Naltrexone—that’s a good start. Impulsivity must be curbed — especially when impulses now are mostly about effective ways to harm yourself. They shake out four pills of klonopin and take them dry, even chewing into one and it’s numbing mint that tastes of relief. Sooner the better with that one. They look at their hands—at mine. Me. 

I begin to tap with my finger tips rhythmically on the meridians of my skull. The temple, then brow, each time I tap one time more than the last. Tapping the cheek bone, either side, and down the meridians that make up me. Chin, upper lip, down to below the collar bone. Deep breathes. I think with each tap reinforcing as if fingers are the hammer hitting anvil: “I am okay.” *Even if it’s not true,* I note, from somewhere nagging. But this truth feels all the better. 

I breathe—and I can feel it’s my own breath. A stare, long and cold at a bottle I know holds antipsychotics. I will not touch the bottle, I know. Though—at this point. I also know I should. I should. I know.

The bottle dissipates and my focus blurs from looking at the bottle as I get deeper into the labyrinth of mirrors that I call my mind. It’ll take days to find my way back out—I know this too. I didn’t stay in dissociate-land long enough to gauge how bad it was exactly—but not recognizing your own face. Pretty severe, that… I’m scared to check the mirror again. 

Better off getting to work for the day. 

I go past the vanity to another place to sit, this a huge hard wood desk. Looks like it could be oak, in another life. Could have been a hundred things. Now it sits here, huge and heavy and imposing on its space. The wooden equivalent of a rusted out car. I flip open the case of my laptop and press a button indicating power then pass by into the darker spot of my flat, flipping on a light as I walk seamlessly into the kitchen.

Carefully I delegate out enough water and coffee grounds for my expresso. Empty the old into recycling. I take moments here to breathe—to be present. To feel as my body moves, and it’s a blessing that it is moving and that I can breathe and be here now. I start to enjoy it, this joyless act. 

This routine. Stick to the routine. 

I bring steaming black coffee back to the nameless artifact of a desk and sit in the opposing, imposing, black Herrman Miller. Typing in username and password, I log on for the day which won’t be ending for some ten hours. Sometimes the best medicine is to get your head into another space. Especially when the symptom and cause of your concern is just a state of mind.

I open an inconspicuous drawer. It’s the jackpot. That’s what I call it—this drawer. It is a jackpot for the right person. A plethora of substances, a veritable paraphernalia of them, stare back at me in their little identical plastic baggies and jars. I reach in and fish out a mason jar. It’s filled to brimming with clear pills of finely grounded greenish gray powder—psilocybin. The dose is small—and that’s the point. I take one with steaming espresso. 

Adjusting myself into the chair that somehow remembers the shape of me—the day starts with checking email. There are two. One is—email. The same that’s been used since forever. The other is self-deleting, everything about it self-destructive and temporary and highly encrypted with the only permanence to it being the actual address itself. 

## `OLD CHAPTERS MASTERLIST.` {#old-chapters-masterlist.}

### `Chapter 1.1` {#chapter-1.1}

The artificial moon hung over Anchorage like a reassuring guardian for a new, nocturnal humanity. The old moon hanging over that, cradling the waxing new in its arms. It was independence day, July 4th.   
The Idiot/Savants are always busy this day, as a matter of course.   
It was minutes before midnight. The temperature had settled at 88 Fahrenheit, where it would stay until it warmed back up to a toasty 200 midday come twelve hours. We were already on site, there wasn’t another minute to waste.   
I stood and contemplated the truck. It was loaded with magnesium alloys and various other combustibles for a real firework freak show. I went down a mental checklist when someone came up in my peripheral.   
“Hiatus,” said a reedy, feminine voice.   
It was Togami. Nobody else would talk to me yet. She’d gotten me into this Idiot/Savant mess on a purely working relationship. Childhood friend, occasional lover, and likeminded individual.   
I glanced at her. It was amazing how much could change in two years, if only in appearance. A tattoo of a sparrow on her neck, a sleeve of a yellow snake in autumn leaves, and several dermals on her face.   
She took a puff of something like a cigarette that glowed blue light at its tip, exhaling crisp vapor into my face. “Are you about ready?” She offered the device to me.  
I took a puff and felt a rush of some unknown stimulant. “A pyromaniac is always ready for arson. Let’s get this over with…”   
I broke off because it was hitting me. Slightly psychedelic effects, like I was seeing a rainbow form in the fireworks display.   
Not that I’d ever seen a real rainbow before.   
Togami slapped my back. “That’ll keep you on your toes.”   
“More like paranoid…” I whispered under my breath. But the effects went away as soon as they had come.   
She shrugged, her shadow making a cascade. “Same difference, for our stakes. Follow me.”   
So I did, not before taking another huff of her narcotics. We walked around the glass building that made one think of what would happen if you threw a rock inside of it.   
Scattering the ground were bodies, some bound in rope and but most strewn on the ground like rag dolls, dark crimson puddles pooling beneath. I peeked behind my shoulder at the fireworks display, one more time—one could never be certain if they were hearing roman candles or gunshots on this day.   
Togami turned around and walked backward, ahead of me. “Are you even armed, Hiatus?” She brandished her hand in a fist, which I knew was a battle gauntlet—a cybernetic glove going to the forearm that enhances innate strength.  
In reply, I flipped open my flight jacket, showing two tomahawks on either side of my shoulders.   
“I’m kinda hoping we run into trouble just so I can see you in battle,” Togami grinned.  
“It’s nothing you want to see, trust me. Ax-murder is just traumatizing.”   
“Ah-ha\! But you can fix that, no?” Togami said.   
It was the truth, but… “I plead the fifth.”   
Togami turned back around as we skirted the outside of this all-glass skyscraper. It was on the other side that we found our destination, an innocuous enough circular platform of metal. We stood on one side as the truck from before rolled up to a stop next to us, also on the platform.   
Togami grabbed a device—not unlike a phone—from her pocket, pressed a few buttons, then the platform started descending moments later.   
I looked into her blue eyes, not unlike my own, and she raised an eyebrow.   
“Tell me, Togami, what’s your philosophy?”   
“You ask my philosophy, but you really mean I/S’s?”  
I nodded. Either one would do.   
“Having second thoughts?”   
I shrugged. “Not really. I am being paid for this.”   
“I/S is a movement without a goal or set of beliefs, but united on the principle that *change must come* and that we’ll be the ones to force it—if that’s what it comes to.”   
“Has diplomacy ever worked?” I asked.  
“Not as far as I know. Then again, I doubt we’ve ever tried.”   
Most terrorist organizations freely admit exactly that—their terrorists. I/S is a bit different, I’ll admit. Race, gender, ethnicity, background. None of it matters, not so long as they march toward an unclear goal by way of ultraviolence.  
“I like to think that these attacks—that they set back ‘the man,’ and if that’s all we can do then so be it.”   
“You’re causing a not small amount of damage to these corporations,” I said. “The exact impact of it is something you’ll likely never truly know.”   
Something shifted in my brain as the elevator came to the bottom, subtle yet distinct. I grabbed my forehead and rummaged through the previous moment.  
“Hiatus, this isn’t right…”   
“I know, be quiet.”   
There was only one logical answer as I looked up at a black asphalt wall where the entrance should be.   
“Togami, someone shifted us into interstice.”   
She gasped.   
It was a good reason to gasp.   
We weren’t expecting one of those types. Which meant a few things, namely that *this operation was expected*.   
Bad news, all around.   
“Can’t you get past it?” Togami whispered.   
“Easily,” I replied. “Just raise the platform and lower it again. But that means anyone stuck in interstice will *stay* stuck.”   
“Hmm—what’s the other option?”   
“That’s asphalt, right?” I pointed to the wall. “Depending on how thick it is, it’s gonna be incredibly difficult to destroy. If we use explosives, the platform will also break. We’re screwed.”   
“We’ve been had, huh? Well, Boss would say you need to break a few eggs to make an omelet. Let’s just get past it.”  
Togami pressed a combination of buttons, the platform raising in response. I felt the shift go back to normal and signaled to go back down as I avoided the trap this time. When we reached the bottom the wall was gone.   
Togami walked in first, and I was close behind.   
Adorned on the ceiling in steady increments were what looked like golden, see through chandeliers of various wires. Known better as quantum computers, a whole server of them. While the incredibly wealthy may be able to afford one, mega-corporations like Shire Electric could afford to have an entire bunker of them.  
“God knows what you could do with this much computer power… you could probably even predict the future,” Togami said.   
“Anyone tapped into these would be just as omnipresent,” I said. “You said you weren’t sure what was down here, right?”   
“Yeah,” Togami said. “Only the Boss knows, supposedly.”   
*Where the hell is he, then*… I thought but kept to myself. Instead, I scanned the area, thankfully nothing was blocking my view.  
“Something is wrong, that’s what you’re thinking, right?”  
I nodded and grabbed a tomahawk from under my jacket, taking aim at one of the chandeliers—computers, I mean.   
The tomahawk bounced right off as if the ax were made of rubber, soundlessly falling to the ground. I went and retrieved it, strapping it back over my shoulder, then turned to Togami.  
“What the hell is that about?” she asked.   
“It just means there’s more than one layer. Being so close to so many quantum computers—there could be many, many layers, indeed…” I turned next to the truck. It was set to follow me automatically, and so it had. I rounded over to the driver's side door and climbed in, rolling down the window.   
“You get shotgun, Togami. No need to hesitate, I’ve got a plan. It’s perfectly safe… for us, at least.”   
I thought I heard her mutter under her breath, but she did as I said and climbed into the passenger seat of the truck. I flipped a switch on the dash, allowing me to control the truck again, and started driving slowly in a circle around the underground.   
“Care to explain what you're doing?”   
“I need silence, so no.”   
What I was doing was in fact looking for a weak spot in interstice, perhaps somewhere I can cut through into the heart of the problem. Sometimes prominent landmarks will be intense enough to grab onto, but since there was virtually nothing inside this bunker there was no chance of that.   
The only chance I had was to run into—and I mean this literally—another person adjacent to us in between spaces *while* trying to cross over. Humans can be conduits in interstice, too.   
We drove up and down the aisles, not going any faster than 10 MPH when I *did* run into something.  
A human I’d seen before. Part of the crew, now glued to the grill of the truck.  
“Fuck\! Ah-h-h\!” The man yelled.  
I stepped on the brakes.   
“Oh my god\! Tyrus\!” Togami screeched.   
She jumped out of the car before I could say ‘stop’…  
I looked ahead. Maybe 20 yards away was a fairy sitting on top of someone's chest, with a hand behind her back—doubtlessly holding a knife to their throat. This was probably the person controlling interstice right now, as well.   
Fairys are synthetic humanoids, and not their proper name, but called so because of their light wings that make use of interstice and allow them to make crazy jumps. They all stand around five feet tall, and generally work for their creators—that’s to say Shire Electric.   
I opened the door of the car and looked to the left. Curly blonde hair with reddish bread. “Hi, Valentino,” I said. “Did I keep you waiting?”   
“Any longer and we’d have lost Gibson,” Valentino replied curtly. “Can you take care of that fairy bitch?”   
“I don’t see why not.” I shrugged as if it were nothing, but there’s always something deeply unsettling about astral duels. “You remember what to do, right?”   
“Yeah, I remember. Now go save Gibson.”   
I took off my shades and put them in my shirt pocket, closing the door to the truck. I walked around to the hood and hopped on, sitting crisscross.   
I took a few deep breaths and put out my arms in front of me, palms out and fingers spread. I closed my eyes.   
As I lowered my arms I imagined another sort of replicant self staying, and separating from me, where my arms had been.   
*Hello, Elliot*.  
I whispered below my breath, “Hi again, Izzy.”   
The second pair of hands fell forward and my vision returned to a new pair of eyes not my own—they were my astral selves, a doppelganger made out of interstice.   
My astral body stood. To anyone else, the area surrounding the body would look like a glimmer, or maybe a mirage. To me, looking through the astral body's eyes, I was in a normal body of a woman.   
I approached the fairy sitting on top of Gibson—I’d have run but complex actions like that are difficult in your astral body. You’d be more likely to trip. She had plenty of time to ready herself, which she promptly did, closing her own eyes.   
Moments later, an androgynous body rose from the fairy, this one only slightly taller than the fairy herself. It was in a yellow dress with a black vinyl hat, otherwise barefoot.   
*Elliot, she must be new to this*, Izzy commentated to me.   
“Looks can be deceiving,” I whispered. “Be careful, nonetheless.”  
Izzy loves nothing more than going all-out. I could practically hear her whine. But there was another reason to err on the side of careful… astral duels hurt.   
Besides, any minute now they’ll have a clear shot of that fairy bitch’s head, and this will all be another page in history.   
I walked over to the androgynous projection and balled my hand into a fist, winding my arm back, twisting the torso, then the follow through and *connecting*.   
The vinyl hat went flying across the room, and I brought my hands back into a defensive position—but too late.   
Her foot had already connected with my hip, sending me off balance.   
Getting hit in your astral body isn’t like getting hit physically. After one connection, certain properties start to affect you depending on a variety of factors. Simply put, shit starts to get *weird*.   
In this instance, it seems like a web has been thrown over me, weighing me down in waves, or maybe seconds is more accurate. I can tell there’s a timer attached to whatever her power is. My vision gets blurry, but not as blurry as her’s surely is from my punch. Then it gets sharper.   
It’s hard to move, hard to move in a kinetic sense. So I make incremental steps back, which is easy enough.   
On a cycle, my vision blurs again briefly, threatening to go black, before I break out of the web again and it sharpens in that cycle.   
This is basic. That fairy really must be new to this.   
A gunshot reverberates through the empty quantum computer room and the opponent's astral self sparkles, before breaking apart into hundreds of infinitely small pieces on the floor.   
I close my astral self's eyes, returning to my own body.   
I let out a sigh…   
“Ah\!” I scream, seeing who’s looking at me so intensely, so closely. “Can I help you, Togami?”   
“You said Izzy? Who’s she?” Togami tilted her head at me.   
“Someone from a long time ago. I might tell you more if you lay the fuck off.”   
Togami put up her hands and walked away. I jumped off the hood of the car and stretched.   
That wasn’t exactly enjoyable, nor was it very smooth since I did get hit.   
Valentino walked by me, a large magnum in hand. So he was the one who fired. Makes sense, being captain of this unit and all.   
Gibson pushed off the dead fairy and sat up looking like he was going to hurl. Can’t say having brain matter that close to you is very comforting, anyway. He rolled away from the stiff and pushed himself off the ground, breathing heavily. You had to wonder why you’d even bring someone like him.   
Valentino clasped him on the back as he caught his breath. “Are you ready?”   
“Y-yeah,” Gibson stifled out. “I was looking, and this one should be perfect.” He pointed directly above him.  
“Hey, Togami,” I said. “What the hell are they talking about?”   
“We’re stealing a quantum computer, or whatever.” She shrugged.   
Those fucking idiots. That was never mentioned to me.   
“Hey, morons\!” I yelled across the court. “Even if you steal one of those, you’ll never have enough power to run one for more than a microsecond. Let’s just destroy ‘em all like you planned, okay?”   
“We might be morons, but we’re also prodigies,” Valentino smiled back at me.   
So if they aren’t idiot/savants they're moron/prodigies. Makes sense. “How the hell are you even gonna get it out of here?” I asked.   
“In the flat of your truck. Start unloading the explosives.”   
“I made the explosives so they wouldn’t have to be moved from the truck. So that if anyone asked questions, there was no truck left to even investigate. Think again, how are you transporting an entire quantum computer?”   
Valentino clicked his tongue. “Fine.”   
“Everyone, get to the elevator\!” I yelled. “You don’t want to be on the same level when this shit goes off.” 

### `Chapter 02` {#chapter-02}

In the modern age, revolutionary fronts are run on drugs, sex, and rock.   
Around any good front is the music, rockstars with charisma, and their fanatics who listen and are inspired to *change*… a sort of mass hallucination for the future. For what could be, and not what is.   
We’ve got a good underground scene here, fueling the fire.  
Liberation is centered around freedom of sexuality, not necessarily the act of sex itself, although there’s quite a bit of that too. When you’re oppressed for long enough, anything that promises you’ll have the freedom for you and yours is enticing.   
That’s exactly so here.   
Drugs are drugs, and I make them. Their hardly even contraband in this day and age, long gone are the days of deadly overdoses. I create what might be called designer drugs, drugs created with a specific intent, to fuel the feeling of the zeitgeist of the times. We call it Elixier, you mix it in with a soda pop of your choice, and your chill when all you’ve done all day is deal with transgressions.   
That’s what we were doing now. Underground, like all houses in this age, is a modest mansion run by the lovely Ferio, a woman as mysterious as she is wealthy, and also a big contributor to our front.   
In the kitchen, I cracked open a sizzling Orange Fanta and took a sip off the top before pouring out a few ounces into the sink. I grabbed an innocuous purple medicine bottle and crack open the seal, carefully pouring four ounces of pink fluid into the drink. Out of my pocket, I grab an orange octagon of stimulant and put that into the one liter as well.  
Putting the cap back on, I gently rock it back and forth before carefully taking off the cap in increments so it doesn’t fizz over.   
“Ahh—this is the life,” I say to myself.   
Just before someone barrages into the house. I turn and look over the sound of the music, a ruckus of loud steps leading directly to me as the door is opened with someone's foot.   
They're carrying a child. They place them on the dining table, naked as the day they were born.   
Someone—someone I don’t know, which is hardly surprising—follows with a first aid kit in hand. They place that on the table as well and open up the kit.   
“What’s going on?” I find myself saying.   
“Are you a doctor?” The woman asks, impatience edging her voice.   
I shrug, taking a drink of Elixier. “I might know enough to save a life.”   
“Then get the hell over here\!”   
I round the corner of the kitchen to the dining area and observe the child—their head is shaved, and they seem to be around 10 or 11 years old if I had to guess. It’s—a girl, by the looks of it.   
But there are no open wounds, nor do I see any bleeding. Scars—there’s plenty of those, to be sure, but she’s not in any sort of critical condition. Her breathing is labored, but her eyes are also closed.   
The man takes out disinfectant, gauze, and bandages.   
“What are you bandaging?” I ask.   
“Do you not see her bleeding\!” the woman screams at me. The man's hands are shaking as he rips open a disinfectant wipe.   
Our eyes meet. He’s dead serious.   
I raise my hands and take a step back, taking another drink of Fanta.   
The man carefully tends to a closed scar on her side, just as if it were actually an open, critical wound.   
I hate to use the voice, the charm, but I see no other way. They’ve somehow fallen under some sort of illusion, and the sooner they break out of it the better. At worst, this could be a horribly elaborate trap.   
I clear my throat, *ahem*, and speak in an ordered voice: “*that child is not wounded.*” The words reverberate as if there’s an echo.   
They both blink several times, look at me, then back to the child. Their hands stop moving, and the woman clutches her head.   
Charming can be very disorienting and doesn’t exactly fix any illusions put on them, so they could still be seeing blood.  
“Tell me what happened,” I said. “Leading up to this.”   
“You’re with group black, right?” The woman said. “We’re what’s left of group red. We found this child on our mission, and we rescued her. But it seems… somehow we were duped.”   
“I’m Hiatus,” I said.   
“Call me Conair,” the woman pointed at herself with a thumb. “And this is Abe.”  
“What was group red’s goal?”   
“Eliminating key members of the Shire’s energy department.”   
“How’d you find a girl when you were doing that?”   
“Deep in Shire’s headquarters—we found they were experimenting on humans. As best as I can tell, she was one of those experiments.”   
I looked at the naked and shivering girl on the table. I had an idea, although it was about as invasive as it gets. I shut it out of my mind for now. “Well, for now, I don’t think a little girl posses much threat. Find a blanket, or better yet, clothes.”  
“I’m not exactly good with kids…” Conair trailed off. I looked to Abe, who shook his head similarly. They were gonna dump this on me? I mean, group red are a bunch of killers, but come on…   
On the other hand, my interest had been piqued by this girl, as my interest is want to do when mysteries are involved. I chugged several ounces of my Elixer. “Fine, I’ll take care of it from here. At least until someone more responsible comes along. You wouldn't mind if I probe her with interstice, right?”   
They both shrugged. Killers to the core. “Nice meeting you, Hiatus,” Conair said, and both her and Abe left from the door they came.   
I turned my attention back to the girl. I saw only one reasonable thing to do in this situation. I took off my shirt, a Palace piece best defined by skate park fashion, and pulled it over the girl's tiny shoulders. It ended up covering most of her body.   
I picked her up in my arms and went to the stairs, a spiral affair complete with a tinted sunroof. By now, the sun was rising. Thanks to the Elixer, I’d be up for many hours to come.   
Down two flights I came to the bedrooms of this mansion. Only the lowest level, the fourth floor, remained. That was mostly just storage, however. I walked down the left hallway to the back fourth door and rapped on the door.   
*Knock, knock—knock, knock*.  
A muffled voice from inside, “who is it?”   
“It’s Elliot and a little girl.”   
The door creaked open, Togami peeking from behind it. “What the fuck?” the door flung open the rest of the way. “Who’s the kid?”   
“That’s what I’m trying to figure out,” I said, walking into her room and laying down the child on her bed. “Group red rescued her, but they don’t seem to want to have anything to do with her now.”   
“Let me have a look,” Togami took a seat on the bed and grabbed the child’s wrist.  
I didn’t bring her here for no reason—Togami is a bit of a nurse, professionally trained even.   
“Has she said anything?” Togami asked. “Mumbled something, maybe? Or has she been like this the whole time?”   
“Just like this. Before she was passed on to me, there was an illusion put on the people that found her—on Conair and Abe. They thought she was bleeding, in some sort of critical condition. I broke it with a charm.”   
Togami carefully peeled the kid's eyelid back and watched, before doing the same to the other eyelid. “I think… she’s in REM sleep. Like, right as we speak.” Togami looked up at me.   
“But that shouldn’t be possible, right? That’s a very light sleep state.”   
“She could have a sleep disorder causing it. I’m not certain.”   
“For now, look at the scars on her body and tell me what they look like to you.”   
Togami peeled back the gray t-shirt I had put on the girl and carefully looked at the many scars across her chest. I took a sip of Elixier and held onto the nearby wall for support. I’d drank too much too quickly…   
“They look like medical scars, not the kind of scars you get from being hurt or abused. The kind you get with surgury.” Togami lowered the shirt, then placed her hands on the girl's head, feeling threw her short hair. “She’s had surgery on her brain, I think. I can feel the scars.”   
“She must’ve been some medical guinea pig… disgusting. Well, is there anything you can deduce?”   
“Well, she’s not in any physical danger as far as I can tell. But that doesn’t mean she’s going to be mentally… all there.”   
I nodded several times. “I’ve got an idea, if you’ll entertain me.”   
“What?” Togami asked.  
“Searching her mind.”   
Togami narrowed her eyes, then looked away. She was against it by instinct, of course. And I wasn’t going to try and justify it. “Sure,” Togami said after a time. “That’s why you brought her here, right? So I could watch over. Fine, do it.”   
I stepped up to the bed and took a seat at the bottom edge, Togami at the front. I reached my hand out and closed my eyes. When I opened them again, I was several feet forward in my astral self.   
*Hi, hello, Elliot*, Izzy said.   
“Izzy, we’re going to search her memories,” I whispered. I doubt even Togami could hear me as I said it.   
My astral arm reached out and grabbed the girl's forehead lightly. And then, in defiance of physical boundaries, the hand and arm sank into the skull. Reality around me warped, taking on the shape of the metaphorical, of the manifestation of psyche. 

I found myself—or something near enough to “*me*”—at a shallow pool, standing in a foot of crisp see through running water, able to see with precision every colorful stone and pebble underfoot. There was a sound of a waterfall, although I saw none. It was autumn here, the maple trees all brilliant colors and their brilliant leaves falling with abandon into the slow moving water.   
Perched on top of an island in between the stream was a cause of concern. There was a magnificently elaborate coffin sitting there, its casket open as if inviting me.   
I stepped up from the water onto the island and peered inside. It was empty, although I knew it shouldn’t be intuitively. *Something* should be there, and the fact that there was *nothing* left me slightly unsettled.   
And I knew it was a coffin for me to fill. That I belonged in there as a wrench belongs in a toolbox.   
I climbed in and laid down, the lid closing on me, and I knew this too to be right and just. It wasn’t dark in the coffin. It was spacious, and there was plenty to read on the top of the lid… or so I thought. But all I could read was:   
“*Yes I said Yes I will Yes*.”   
I searched around for words, words besides those ones, and found what might be a name. “*Bloom*.” Perhaps that was her name?   
A deluge suddenly hit all around me, no telling where it came from, but I could feel the coffin break free of the sand bar it was once on top of. I was floating through the slow river, and the sound of a waterfall came closer and closer…   
Until I was in freefall for a few moments, and I thought I saw the words change:  
*KILLMEKILLME*  
*KILLMEKILLME*

I found myself in a similar place, but not the same. It was winter, the trees all bare and naked. There was a horrible cold now, especially in the water, now stagnant. Enough to make me shiver and my breath to come out as fog.   
The water was tinged red, and I walked to the place where the coffin might have been before, but the water only got deeper. I kept walking towards *it*, now waist deep in water, wading through. I looked below and saw something prophetic.   
It was the girl, her blood wisping up from several feet below. She was suspended there in the water as if attached to a stretcher. I dove down and grabbed her frail, freezing body back to the surface. Where my hand touched her skin, wisps of vapor like dry ice exposed to sunlight came off.   
She coughed.   
“Bloom,” I said. My voice was feminine.   
It must be Izzy’s body I inhabit in here.   
The girl opened her eyes and mouth, water pouring out of every orifice.   
I waded with her in my arms to the bank, to the dead grass of winter on the embankment. “How do we get out of here?” I asked.   
She shook her head. I knew that to mean, “you can’t.”  
*KILLMEKILLME*  
*KILLMEKILLME*  
*KILLMEKILLME*  
I got us out of the water and scanned around. Behind the many trees, there was an indent, concave, along the sheer neverending walls of rock. I approached the place, even with fear gripping my stomach.   
Inside the cave, there were shadows dancing about like ballerinas on the walls. They all congregated in a place near the back, shifting and moving but staying most there, leading the way.   
There, stumbling in the dark with the girl in my arms, I ran into a coffin unceremoniously laid on the ground. I could feel the girl shake her head, but I knew this was the way out if there was one at all.   
She’d been chained in water that was once her paradise, and now on dryland, she’d either be reborn or she’d die. I saw no other way. I laid her down in the coffin, and the lid surreptitiously closed shut before me in that deep darkness. I put my back against the coffin and watched the shadows dance before I heard a rumble of the earth above me and rocks fall all around me.   
I closed my eyes. 

When I opened my eyes I forgot where I was. More than that, it seemed I forgot *who I was*. I looked around, seeing a concerned face but no meaning.   
*Elliot, you’re back. You went into that girl's mind-place*, Izzy said. *You did it, you broke her out of her spell*.   
I felt my face with both hands, the sensation of my own skin like a foreign object. I breathed a deep sigh of relief and laid down on the bed as my breathing increased. I had lost myself in there, lost sight of myself.   
Whoever put that together is one tricky, dastardly son of a bitch.   
“She’s coming out of it,” Togami said. “Almost like she were in a coma.”   
“That’s not far from the truth, in this case…”   
“What’d you figure out?”   
“Someone put her in a mind loop. It could’ve triggered on any condition, but I’d bet it was when she was taken from Shire’s headquarters. Like a fail-safe.”   
“Sounds fucked up.”   
“You have no fucking idea. Her name is Bloom, by the way. In case I forget.”   
“Bloom, please sit—”   
I felt a small body cling to my chest for dear life. I looked down, seeing the shaved head of the girl with her arms wrapped around me. “Tu su servasti,” Bloom said.   
“…”  
“Did she just speak Latin?” Togami asked.
