I’d end my violent March insistent on  
mine own death, I said, and repeated thus:  
when April came \- I would heal.   
I’ve only split blood to show in May.  
I guess violence is a bitch to kick. 



Like with the Great Ones in times past,   
God's & Kings, I make exception   
for a lavished princess. I'll kneel & kiss  
the bottom of your feet. It would  
be my blessing, I insist. For you, sister,  
anything to get you off my fucking ass. 



O blood, blessid sacred thing.   
Nothing pays quite like.   
I let myself bleed now \- bless me.   
Bring me back to myself.   
Flames will engulf hard oak,   
to bring balance to me \- now unclean.   
O ash\! Blessid ash, thank you.   
I am not unlike you, should I let  
this heat consume me too. 



I said I wanted scars that looked like   
A bucket of stars of the sky spilled over  
And across my skin. I got what I want.   
I will not say be careful what you wish for,   
If these scars are all stars, one of them must  
surely be a shooting variety. 



I am a vagrant in a field with no shoes on  
I bend my knees and brush the grains  
As I walk without an end  
Thinking of this as a prayer  
I am another grain in fields of it  
As meaningless as sand in Sahara   
It’s a lot of work   
to continue drawing breath,  
Least I breath the wrong way  
And the desert blow away with me.
