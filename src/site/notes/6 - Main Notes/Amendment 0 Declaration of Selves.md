[[6 - Main Notes/Amendment 1 How to Find Magic\|Amendment 1 How to Find Magic]], [[WhoAmI\|WhoAmI]] 


**WE, the states inside the person born as Logan Baxter** writ here we have an unalienable set of beliefs and values we all must align on in order to be part of the overall system and take over headspace. Here, we agree on a core that grounds us all together. Else, we are part of an outer system. We agree, should any one part alter or state violate these severely enough we shall work in tandem to correct or otherwise rid ourselves of the offender.

*When we forget what is true of us we will return here to keep true to our ancient wishes.*

*We all agree to help the host realize and accept our pain, that our existence will never be the same, and that we are safe now.*

*AMEN.*

1. The only thing you can do is love — the only thing eternally true.  
   1. When you harbor hate, remember anyone can hold resentment all their life. That’s easy. It takes a brave heart to love someone who slighted you, however.

2. There is no such thing as evil. Everybody considers themselves doing good and doing the right thing — even when they hurt you deeply.   
	1. All communication is an approximation and as such most if not all conflict is based on miscommunication, not ill will.  
	2. If you ever need help moving on remember that if there is no inherent evil then there is no inherent good. Don’t dwell on right and wrong, follow your heart. 

4. No matter how you feel in your state, you are a woman in physicality. And no matter how you feel, no matter the state, it is valid and OK to feel the way you do.  
	   1. A woman has words as her world. You are only as good as your promise.   
	   2. Be proud of who you are, whoever that may be. 

6. If given the option to spend free time on yourself or grow that around you, you will always pick to pour into the community as if it were just you taking care of your own garden.  
	   1. On an individual level, picking between your own good or giving that good to someone else you will err on the side to keep it to yourself.

8. You will always strive to rid yourself of cognitive dissonance whenever and wherever  found. Anything that is incongruent with another belief you hold is a serrated edge to your mind.  
	   1. Always go out of your way to learn more. There is no state in your orbit for an excuse to not be bettering yourself. 

10. No matter who you are, admit the only thing you have control over is yourself. Don't be deluded into thinking you can change someone else, no matter how much that hurts.   
	   1. Seeking closure ends in more pain. It's a futile endeavor. Move on. 

12. If you're lost, be sincere and don’t doubt your feelings if you know them true. Everything else will naturally follow.   
	   1. Do not conform to fit into a place you do not belong. Do not overstay your welcome.

14. Don’t let a man piss on your leg and tell you it’s raining. Have respect for yourself.  
	   1. Don’t throw stones then hide hands. Own up to everything you did.

16. A boundary is only good if they know they broke it, how that makes you feel, and if you then enforce it with the removal of yourself from their influence for an appropriate amount of time.   
	1. Apologies are useless. A change of behavior is what matters. Don’t let someone back in because they said sorry, you let a wolf in that way.
