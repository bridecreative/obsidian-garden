(Written to my mentor)

Hi.


I wrote a long while ago — and this is one of the few things I can remember just off the top of my head without going back to it — that this phase of my life here in Tennessee would be about boys, clothes, and a good book. 

Let’s review how that worked out…

I have not been reading 1/4th as much as I wanted to, so that failed. As for clothes, I am slowly working on that. My collection is starting. I got a tattoo, my first one. I got piercings! Ones that feel symbolic for this phase in my life. 

And it all went to hell with the boys part, didn’t it?

I’ve never felt the same after first love. I think men and women do share that in common. I always wondered, ‘why do people feel like they need to be in a relationship?’ And I now have my answer. When you feel that… intensity. For the first time. It unlocks some sort of flood gate that never closes. You need to keep the river of serotonin and oxytocin the relationship gives you or your life is empty. 

I’m having something like that.


I also realized that I’m very antsy to get back the things I use to have. Several pairs of nice shoes, up-to-date electronics I’ve had my eyes on… clothes I like, besides. That’s probably why clothes are on that list, see? It was subconscious — but I missed having a wardrobe of clothes I like to pick from. I said I wanted to sit there and look pretty for a boy while reading a good book and watching them do stupid shit. I believe myself — but a lot of women don’t care about looking pretty in clothes, they put as much effort in as men. I threw on blue jeans, whatever shirt was in the clean pile and suitable for the weather. Ta-da! 

I still think that way, honestly. I try to put on makeup and never get past blush, lipgloss, maybe some concealer to make my nose look less fucked up. Oh, concealer is great to hide facial hair. That’s it. As I get more clothes I did go back to throwing on whatever matches and is clean. Even funnier to me is that — I wear a lot of the same colors, I find myself going back to the same sort of patterns I liked as a boy. Some shit don’t change even when you try to change it, like I said I’m done with blue jeans. No, I’m not.

So I don’t think I wanna ‘look cute,’ exactly. The actual important part was to have — what I use to have, basically. Things I have interest in, kept an eye on. Whether it impresses anyone or not is bottom rung importance, boy or not. 

So that’s why one of the things I try to always keep in mind is that I got here with one suitcase and a computer… Give it time. 


As for reading… I should do that a lot more. 

Instead, after I realized boys are trouble, I know this phase of my life is more like ‘moderation and where you put energy.’

Now let’s see where how that works out.
