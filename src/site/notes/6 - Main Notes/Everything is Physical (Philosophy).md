[[6 - Main Notes/Bees have the same reward system as humans\|Bees have the same reward system as humans]], [[Lowes Philosophical Thoughts\|Lowes Philosophical Thoughts]], 



There was a moment at Lowes where I realized a lil tid bit of a fact that changed my mind on if there was anything immaterial in the world. Before, I saw it that all things could be explained by physical materials.

- Bees have the exact same reward system as humans.
This single fact alone changed how I thought of the question. If this was true, how could I not be that everything was so interconnected by the physical, this little bumblebee has the same reward system as *me* that it could be anything but the conclusion that everything is made of the same materials? This tipped me from flip-flopping into at least 51% certainty that everything *had* to be made of the same materials.
	unless if science were lying or mistaken. which I will assume is not true, though is not impossible.

Now, the [[Argument for Immaterial (Philosophy)\|Argument for Immaterial (Philosophy)]] 

Here is an argument for both.
