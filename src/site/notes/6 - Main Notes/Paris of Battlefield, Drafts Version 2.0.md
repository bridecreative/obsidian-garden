## `Chapter 001 First Encounter with the Unknown` {#chapter-001-first-encounter-with-the-unknown}

She went by many names previous to our fateful encounter. She wore names like how most buy clothes \- whatever suited her taste at the time. What is known of her before that day for truth? Very little as it stands.

All of Appalachia to the top of the panhandle back then was ruled by what amounted to Petty Kings. They all came from a common if diverse descent, their forefathers were the remains of the United States, though it was no longer “United,” nor were they even “States” after five millennia of decay. It is as it was, a collection of colonies built on the back of the unwanted and rejected. They called themselves all Brothers and Sisters, they were certainly a confederacy with a family structure. But the only thing they loved more than killing other people was killing each other.

That was the world she was born into. We peer back now and see it as a stage, and herself an actor. But it was chaos at her birth.

Of her mother she said she was strange. “She had burns all over her body. People feared her openly, like one might revere a powerful God who hears all.” I got this special glimpse on a moonless night. She asked me to walk with her and we found ourselves in a cemetery without a name, sharing wine out of the bottle. Her mother was wed to one of the Petty Kings, a particularly brutal one. “I was not his seed. Even as young as four I could tell just by looking at my siblings.”

It was moonless quite on purpose. She refused to let even lovers see her nude. We drank and drank after copulation and the stars were so bright, the milky way just as much an exhibition as we must’ve been in that cemetery. I said to her then that *the only thing more radiant than the stars tonight is you*. Her hand reached out, almost reflexively. A caress. Her eyes glimmered in the dark and I felt them burning into my soul like a brand stating *yes, you’re mine*. And it was true. Even now I still belong to her. Many of us do.

“Father only wanted what he couldn’t have,” she explained to me. “My mother was married to another powerful person. So he wanted her, and that the cost would be extreme only made Mom more tempting.”

She told me, then, the fate of that family and I swore to never say.

I’ll say only what she would readily admit \- even if it was only at gunpoint. There was a huge blaze, the mansion of her youth with some renown – even the foundation melted. An inferno. Nearly everyone but she perished.

I’ll tell you what I touched in that graveyard \- her skin like the scorched earth she would have walked away from. It couldn’t have been pretty to look at – but I loved the uneven, odd smoothness to it that I was only allowed to feel. Her mother had these scars too. She described her life once, “as above, so below.” I think it’s more cyclical than divine. Her mother burnt something so she did too. It was written in her flesh.

When I met her she went by Paris. I’ll die sooner than I forget her greeting. She took a short barrel action lever that was made of three different metals and two woods from across her back and laid it down on my counter that had only ever seen mail.

“If you don’t give me paid work I’ll kill myself on the eve of tomorrow.”

What do we know of her? Her quaff of curly of blonde hair, like platinum stands sticking out electric, hidden under a hat a size too big to fit her unevenly cut mop. She smelt like what a lady never should, and her face had at least two different layers of grime and grease rubbed into it.

I almost laughed. Almost. Said, “Shit, if it’s that serious you can start now\!” I opened a little hatch to let her in and was beginning to explain, but her hands were already moving, she’d begun sorting mail \- clearly practiced. I only wonder now how many other times she’d used that same line in other post offices across the country.

It was a turbulent time as it was. They’d call it a human migration, now. Back then it was just people and whatever remained of their families looking for a place worth calling home.

 

She wrote in a journal of sorts. She’d sketch things that caught her eye and make note of her day or week but nothing so mundane as what she ate. She was always writing, everyone knows that. What was she writing in? It wasn’t that journal, sparce as it is. Where did all that writing go? Like a lot of hers it seemed to disappear. Like it wasn’t made for this world and only had a set time to exist before it was spirited away where it – and she – truly belonged.

Her entry for today (it’s almost never makes mention of exact date) was, “When I set foot in that hamlet I knew it was the epoch I’d been seeking for and the end of the senselessness whose wake was only bloodshed and trauma I’d been agent of.” She’d see a lot more of that. Be direct cause of it. But it had cause, and maybe that’s why she would inflict it. Maybe.

Warmongering was the rule with few exceptions for thereabouts. Balance could never take root let alone it’s just throne, and the further south was even the worse if you were a woman. So no, difficult to think of now, but it wasn’t unheard of to see a perfectly fine lass traveling alone, even armed, and when you did find one it was the usual that they’d lost a lot if not everything.

She smelt faintly of copper and strongly of week old hooch from the bar down the street. I asked her then if she came from Colorado. She replied that she doesn’t answer the rhetorical. It’s true, she’d be more likely to kill before she answered a rhetorical question. *How was Colorado*, I asked instead.

She wouldn’t answer me, not then. She started somewhere in Tennessee I’d learn later. She put her nose to the dirt and started racking up miles and found herself out of the colonies of her home and to her relative safety. Found she had a knack for shooting. It was a bit more than that. 

“I wanted anything that made me feel and that often looked like pain.” But even this admittance, later, isn’t the full story. She earned quite the reputation. The woman could kick ass and wasn’t afraid to shoot first. She always gave different names, all of them Greek, so her reputation was more myth than fact to people.

This was almost certainly the intended effect. No coincidence. Paris – as she’d stick to once she found my sleepy village – was calculating. There is no way to describe her without some conjecture to “truth,” and “motives.” The thing about truth is that it’s personal. And the thing about motives is that they’re constantly changing.

 

 

 

At that time the most Paris ever motivated for was thirst in all its forms. “Shy girls, fine wine. The less talking the better.” She was more a lady killer than killer of man \- and she killed a lot of men. She often said, “they want to play games, let it be for stakes.” This referred to her always calling any fight a game and her belief that masculinity is synonymous with violence. I don’t think she hated men – I think she saw the language they speak in with no qualms speaking it herself. Men were toys to her – maybe that’s why anything from a bar room fight to war was just a game wagered in blood through her eyes. Some part of her turned off. It was just the part that cared about spilt blood.

Her love of women was famous. I’d seen her once write a poem looking at a woman with eyes like a hungry wolf. Eyes never left the prey, not while writing nor when she folded it into a paper airplane. When it hit its target over yonder and was unfolded the lady fainted the moment their eyes locked… As if cupids arrow accidentally killed it’s object of desire.

Of men, she said they “are like alcohol – too much is poison.” *You don’t apply*, she said to me whenever it came up. Still, she was no monk and was known to partake in the opposite gender. It was about emotions with men – and attention, often enough. “There were whole territories I traveled across where I’d gussy up and go city to city just to watch the men fight over me,” she added that she didn’t remember one of them, *I was too drunk*. What she offered was good company – for a short while. She got tired of breaking hearts quick enough. 

“Men can’t understand the feminine \- they need to borrow a whole woman to translate it for them.” This is always how she would start a triad with a man about which sex was superior. *Women are one sex wiser*, she’d always chime in over the opposing male. “We have to be because we alone are given the gift to birth life \- any man can be stupid enough to take it away.”

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

### `Cuts from PT. 1.`  {#cuts-from-pt.-1.}

We know from her curly blonde hair that she came from some military family. What remained of the Marines after five odd millennium of decay. After Phantasia. After they made that pact with the Italians. She couldn’t hide that heritage. Not that you’d want to – there was prestige there, power even. But she was Italian, no mistake. Why feel connected to the spiritually neighboring Greeks?

 Many of the older of us still wonder how in such short time order could be borne of the chaos we had always known. We know the Mother of our stability, the Queen of the Peace we enjoy and we’ll cherish her in our hearts until we too return to dust with her. I’ll say now it is good she is dead in only that if she were alive, I’d be dead writing this as I am.

 

Where to begin?

 

She started an aimless trek looking for something worth dying for. By the time she reached the edge of where the east meets the south she had decided men were not worth dying for. She figured if there was anything worth while in the south they wouldn’t let her participate due to her sex, so she wandered west until hitting Colorado – it might be more appropriate to say Colorado hit her.

 

 

 

 

America, then, was only America in name and hadn’t been the united of anything in a good long time. There was about five millennium of decay from Phantasia to the day Paris was born.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

A story where someone in an undefined part of the world (the person themselves doesn’t even know at the beginning) goes to the post office and demands they give her a job or she’ll kill herself the eve of tomorrow.

 

 

 Of arguments, nothing got under her skin.

 

 

## `Chapter 001 PT. 2`  {#chapter-001-pt.-2}

What anyone will say who’s seen her even once – beauty. Her face then was smudged with dirt and layered with grease – but she was still beauty incarnate. There was something otherworldly about her complexion. It was like how a villager might have talked about seeing royalty pass through their village in clothing so extravagant they couldn’t even dream of the like.

The name too, not that I knew it quite then, but Paris. Of the classics, said to be the most beautiful woman of the world. She lived up to the name if ever anyone did. She had a thing for the Greeks. Everything she did was tinged of them and their myth if only in allusion or hinted at by nom de guerre.

That’s how I knew for certain, years after the fact, where she traveled from. Greek names, always. Her descript was usually enough, yeah – but people tend to remember names attached to what they value like her. People recall her as if she were a rare animal they’d almost captured. No wonder she wore a gun. She travelled from some place at the edge of the eastern states where it meets south and their definitions blur. Somewhere in the middle of this land mass, after a massacre, but there were so many and all of them so horrible I figure it makes no difference which one caused her to start her travel.

 

 

I asked a few things, then. Or meant to. “Where are you going?”

And she looked me strait in the eye. That’s the other impression you’ll always hear from anyone who’s seen into her face, hers looking into yours. One engineer would describe it best as “the feeling that nothing you could possibly say she couldn’t understand instantaneously, and maybe better than you.”

She said, “I was wondering where I am.”

“Did you want to know the year, too?”

Then she brought her attention back to the letters and I felt somehow very alone all at once. I apologized under my breath. “We are in a trifecta of states,” I said. “Here is where Wyoming and Utah and Colorado meet and one of the few safe places I’ve found.”

“So where is Nevada?”

That was an interesting question, and I said as much. “You mean so you can avoid it, right?” And she nodded her head hidden behind that baseball cap – it gave me an overwhelming déjà vu leading to a long pause. “It’s at least 200 miles to the east. Where are you headed?”

“Someplace worth fighting for. Anywhere that is, I’ll be.”

She had mannerisms that reminded one of their great grandparents that they can scarcely recall for they were so young when they last saw them in good health, as if they inherited the memory and feeling of her visage in another life. It was primordial. Whatever youth she appeared to have was only that – surface deep.

That made me think, which itself was strange for me back then – previous to meeting her, I tried my best to not think and had gotten quite good at it after years of practice. Someplace, she says. It still rings clear to me. So I told what I thought.

“There’s no such place in America worth your life – there hasn’t been in a long, long time now. If you want a state worthy of staking your life on, you’re gonna need to crave it out yourself.”

When I looked in her eyes then I saw another one of those other ancient looks, though this one had nothing to do with the quality and age of her soul but something most all females \- at least of the ones I’ve known \- can nonverbally convey, however it is they do that.

“I would like to have you over for dinner,” I found myself saying.

And she nodded. Yes.

I asked if she’d come from across Colorado. She nodded in the affirmative. That’s what she’d meant when she said she was looking for a place worth fighting for. Of Colorado, Paris wrote “the people are as worthless and shifty as the sand they’ve built on. Just as irradiated as their homes.” Ruthless, but true. She continues, “I’d sooner trust a known serial killer than the average mother in these parts.”

She nodded her head again, almost imperceptibly. Hidden behind the black baseball cap, a smaller voice, “when you start talking of carving out land you pay more than personal stakes… what would you pay? What if the cost is to forfeit your family into generational slavery? What if in payment of defeat they wipe your heritage, your culture?”

She stops her hands to inspect my face. “Where do you draw the line, then? What is too high a price?”

 

 

 

I will tell you all there is to know of her, which is quite little when she stumbled drunk into my local post office. You’ve likely heard of her infernal, burning life after that day, most of which is various shades of great and horrible. I’m reminded of her own words. “Few good men are great, and few men become great by good.” The irony was, of course, that she was not ‘men.’

Of her life before that fateful meeting there is only myth now. The dust never settled. To this day, people claim to have witnessed her once, before then \- not unlike sightings of cryptids, always elusive and indefinite. Only ever adding to the legend.

Even after all the glory, nobody will take account of being part of her conception or birth. She said herself she felt like she wasn’t born but appeared into painful existence fully formed and adult. This is an allusion to Athena, as best as I can tell \- though it still rings true.

Anyone who’s known her will admit it’s impossible to imagine her young \- as a meek girl, or ever having an awkward stage of any kind. Anyone who met her would only admit that. The first and most apparent thing about her was that she was intelligent to an extreme. People who’ve not met her always mention her beauty, but if you spoke two words to her, you knew simply by looking in her eyes. One physicist described it as, “feeling as though there is nothing you could possibly say that she couldn’t comprehend instantly, and maybe better than you.”

Of her past, I know she used different names for every few towns she passed by. When she got to my work place, she called herself Paris. In the past, it’d been something else of some other Greek legend.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

### `Cuts 002` {#cuts-002}

The first I met Morgan she stumbled into my local post office. She wore a canvas duster that was too big because it was for a male and she stank. A baseball cap and dirty face almost hide her beauty – almost. She opened carried, by no means unusual around these parts, except she was she. I’d never seen a woman bear arms till then, when she reached behind her back and slung her sawed off rifle onto the counter.

“If you do not give me paid work by tomorrow eve, I’ll kill myself.”

 

 

You have no doubt heard tale of the woman Morgan. There are few that haven’t.

 

 

 

After Fantasia, the only thing that meant anything were the former U.S. Marines, the catholic church, and some companies in California so large that they ran the state. Then the world decayed for four hundred some odd years. Unfortunately, that power never shifted.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

## `Chapter 002  Fallon son of Demons` {#chapter-002-fallon-son-of-demons}

I was in jail again and this time really wasn’t looking to pan out for me. I couldn’t even explain why I was in there \- it was just routine for me at that point and it was for that very reason that more permanent solutions were being openly considered. The Mojave, it was for me. It was for anyone with any sort of problem whatsoever. If you could drag it to the Mojave you had yourself a permanent solution.

It was, in a word, exile. You were sent Mojave you had rejected all your natural born rights. In that scenario, death is the desirable outcome. It’s the only time cattle slavery is overlooked, as taboo as it is. They give you a razor when they drop you off and if they really hate you they give you rope – it’s a bit of a joke, no trees being in a desert. Most people use the razor.

I don’t think they were considering a rope for me in particular \- they seemed pretty torn on the whole business in its totality. I could hear them talk about it. There was just the one cell. It was mostly a holding tank when locals got too rowdy and drunk. Towns like these, people volunteer to do the police work as it rises up.

There were two men talking to my victim. They looked like fathers, not investigators, they definitely didn’t feel right today putting me to judgement. It looked like they’d want nothing more than to go home to their wives and children, and it was clear to me that when they looked at me that’s who they were seeing. Their own sons.

I was really fucked, let me make it as clear as possible. These two men had only ever practiced clemency and they were still coming back to agreement of how I should die – not if. When and how. That was the question for me.

Paris appeared to me as a silhouette as she marched through the door from community hall. Light surrounded her contour and I thought if all you needed was beauty to be angelic, she more than met requirements. I’m not sure her position at that time, I don’t know why she was there to this day.

She talked in that small voice that makes men lean in to hear. The fathers and my victim seemed to tense up. She handed a full purse. It held more than enough gold to smooth over my transgression. One of the men lifted up his hands like he was being held up at gun point, the other looked at the ground and I didn’t need to see his face to know his expression was chagrin. Then they both parted to let her through. As she strode down to me I felt like I was seeing an embodiment of some higher power, something great.

She tilted her head at me. The two fathers couldn’t be judges, but she couldn’t not. If she had a scale built into her head, I’d think that only made sense. In her eyes you could see her calculating my worth. My age, my race, physicality, and the trajectory of my causality up to now and into a future unknown to the lesser. I felt myself in its time and place.

I was in a jail cell.

Paris leaned in on the iron grate bars that held me in. Her eyes \- half lids \- sank clean through me.

“You’re the son of the last mason to live in this town. Did your father teach you much?” And I nodded, for that was all I could do. “I won’t reign you in. I won’t tame you. But if you work hard for me, I’ll never forsake you. I can only give you purpose and love.” And I began to weep. “You’re mine now,” she said. “I adopt you, and your title will stay the same.”

They called me then Fallon son of Demons. It was always in jest before. I was unruly, and they didn’t like either of my parents. It would mean a whole different thing now, I’d more than earn it in time. My last name would change to Battlefield. And she’d keep her promise – I was never forsaken again from that day, no matter how heinous I would be.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

## `Chapter 003.1`   {#chapter-003.1}

It all started with wanting to take a bath. There. People make a huge show about meanings and intentions and motivations, but it was that simple – she wanted a proper bathing like she’d known in her home. Things would get a lot more complicated – true. But the three of us plus one interested merchant did not think ourselves cohorts of anything at that point and to say we set off with some great intention is simply the way the feeble cope with the truth of the universe. It was entropy if it was anything – simple chaos.

I think the first time we second guessed our unsaid leader was the onboarding of the teenage butcher. He had as many nicknames as people who knew him, and his reputation proceeded him. I, myself, called him Havok after that play I saw very drunk once. “Cry Havok\!” I recall, well yes – if you called Havok you necessarily were calling for bloodshed.

When I looked at Fallon, Havok, the teenage butcher previous to that day, I thought I could understand how Genghis Khan must’ve been like as child. I think he was the first of us that treated Paris not like a person, but a religious object to worship. An early adopter, maybe. All I remember is seeing him covered head to foot in splotches of clay – god, there was so much of the stuff. He’d been at it three days when me and the merchant by name of John were just – watching. It was something to behold. You had to be there.

“It’ll be a miracle,” John said. “Nothing short of it.” John was a ladies man, but good business was his first and true love. I’d never met a kinder man.

“He’s killed three men and raped – well, at least two women now.” I remember telling him that about that fiery haired, burly sixteen year old Fallon. He promptly went up and offered him, thick in a state of mixing clays, some of his own coffee. The kid spat and John took huge steps back to me.

“Why’d you do that,” I asked.

“To look into his eyes. He did all that and worse.”

“What do you think?”

“He’ll haunt wherever he goes – be like a living, walking talking plague.”

 

 

 

 

 

### `Cuts 003.01` {#cuts-003.01}

 

 

Back then, there was a lot of faith that didn’t feel like it. I think the first time we doubted our then unsaid leader was the recruitment of the teenage butcher, Fallon. He had as many names as people who knew him, and his reputation proceeded him.

I called him Havok because he called me a dog. I knew when to bow to someone greater, which I did often and loudly. I myself, the humble servant. Well, on paper at least.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

## `Chapter 003.3 John Seller of Love` {#chapter-003.3-john-seller-of-love}

My philosophy is simple – it starts and ends with keeping everything at the minimal. If someone gives you something complex, you put it under flame and see what it’s made of. Whatever is left is what matters. Ashes are worthless. People ask me how I do it. I ask how you do not.

I’ll be the first to say being tall and handsome gave me a leg up. I think if I were five foot three and ugly as sin, my disposition would be the same. Though, the sex would be a lot less frequent and intense.

How it all started was thoroughly bizarre and certainly complex. I put it under flame and the results were a profit. That’s all I need at the end of the day, but I did keep an especially keen eye always on the progress. Sooner rather than later, I was sucked into it and as much agent as anyone else involved at the time

 

 

                                                               	

## `Chapter 003.5 John, Seller of Goods & Lover of Many` {#chapter-003.5-john,-seller-of-goods-&-lover-of-many}

People ask how I do it. I say how do you not. 

It’s not good to give away trade secrets. I’m well and retired now \- so I will say as there is nothing to possibly lose. When you're given something of mystery you put all their words in a pot to simmer under flame. I come back in the morning, and I consider who I’m supposed to serve the results to. Sometimes it’s poison \- and poison does have its uses. Sometimes it’s edible, but you wouldn’t put it on your own table.

This particular stew? Very strange mixture, indeed. Sometimes you don’t even need to put it under flame, the raw materials just smell. My buddy Lukas came to me as a middleman. We grew in Battlefield together, trusted if anyone was, but for shifty trade? No, I think not. What he was asking for was simple enough, it was the sheer quantity.  

He handed me a list like I was grocery shopping. I remember, he asked me “can you do it you think?” The question is never if something can be done, it’s if it can be funded. I was not as cool headed when I relayed it to him, though. And he said something I’ll never forget. “Post Office has it covered.” I don’t think he shrugged, but I imagine he did figuratively if not literally. I really had to sit on that one, really let it all stew. 

And I investigated, besides. It was seemingly all above board. The Post Office is absolutely allowed the authority to create a facility of any kind in the needs of its community. Often enough, this is a bar if the local one is too rowdy. People come to meet there, get a beer, and go next door to pick up the mail before going home. 

None of that is strange.

* The money though. The tons of material and its odd specificity. I like to keep my hands in many different trades, but this would take at least a year of dedication so faithful it’d make my wife jealous.
