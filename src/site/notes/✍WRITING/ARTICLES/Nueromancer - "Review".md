## Part 1: The last time ‘The Future’ existed. 

I remember talking with my uncle I lived with in the hillbilly law Mountains of Northern California about Cyberpunk. I told him, this book, Neuromancer. It created this genre, Cyberpunk. He didn’t know what that was, so I said it was like Bladerunner. After I told him how those share common themes he said, “that’s not how copyright works.” I said, “you can’t copyright a genre.”

“But if it all stemmed from this one book using all the same parts of it it’s plagiarism.”

My uncle makes mules seem really easy going and open minded and arguing with him feels like trying to hammer nails in with your open palm but more than that I didn’t really have a good rebuttal. Not one that dismantled his argument. 

William Gibson created the sub genre of science fiction ‘Cyberpunk,’ even if my uncle thinks you can’t do that. And maybe Gibson could have said, ‘hey, this collection of ideas all put together are wholly mine.’ I don’t know enough about copyright law to say if you can legally do that or not — but it’s the premise that’s interesting. Can you rob the world of a genre of fiction like that? Where would we be without his creation?

This book and the books inspired by this book are the intersection of so many things that we are still looking towards today. Transhumanism basically originates from the ideas first fleshed out here, for one. The idea of brain chips, deep freezing bodies so you can sleep for 50 years at a time, transferring your consciousness into digital form, space hotels, the internet, the term cyberspace, a dystopia where private organizations run the world. So much more, that’s the tip of it, but some of the stuff I could mention would be minor spoilers so let’s leave it at that.

This also happens to be the last time we had a vision of the future… Gibson took a look at the modern day he was in and wrote a novel of where today would end up. It was less ‘prediction’ and more ‘vision,’ borderline ‘visionary’ even. Today, right now, is the future. Maybe not the exact one he predicted, like it doesn’t have as much rain and neon lights but it sure is dystopic and we’re getting brain chips because of Elon Musk and Neurolink, Jeff Bezos is trying his hardest to make a space hotel, and we’re closing in on genetic engineering being a practical solution to long running problems. The internet became a thing in a much less cool form than he envisioned and yeah, we don’t say cyberspace anymore but we did for a while and we did because Gibson made the word and didn’t copyright it. 

Every huge project has a ‘perfect vision’ made of it, usually it’s the first stage of things. Disney does and they call it the blue sky phase. In a perfect world, what does this look like? If there is no restraint, if your money were infinite, what do you want this to be like for the people using it? 

Neuromancer is that. It’s the perfect vision we look to. I think people like Elon Musk are even getting close to making the dystopia exactly as described\!

This book was published in 1984\. We still don’t have a vision of something new. Neuromancer is the last time ‘The Future’ existed, we still aspire to its ideas both as guidance and completely on accident and if only for that reason you should read it.

Philosophy time:

You actually use philosophy everyday so don’t be intimidated.

Hauntology,

Transhumanism. 

## PART 02: PHILOSOPHY

Now, you’re probably thinking you’ve gone your whole life not needing to know any philosophy and that a section dedicated to it won’t do you good now. News flash buddy, you practice philosophy so much that you couldn’t escape it if you wanted to. 

If you have a view on politics you practice a trove of philosophical beliefs. If you believe in the rule of law you practice philosophical ethics which is the subject of what is right and wrong, the same if you have a moral compass, that’s ethics too. Ethics is everywhere. If you believe in a religion you have so many philosophically grounded beliefs it’s practically radiating off you as if you were made of enriched uranium, and if you don’t believe everything you’re told you practice epistemology — the philosophical subject of knowledge and truth.

If you believe in something it almost necessarily brings you, one way or another, to why you believe it and that is the essence of philosophy. Thinking about thinking.

So you should be interested in this section. It’s actually highly relevant to why things are the way they are right now and if that doesn’t mean anything to you then I don’t know why you’re even reading this, even so much as clicked on the link.

Okay, for the two of you still interested. First, 

the end of ‘The Future.’

~~Cancel culture doesn’t work.~~ 

But somehow we did successfully cancel the future.

All you need to do is have any knowledge whatsoever of architecture. No, not even that. All you need is eyes and two brain cells to spark connections together. You’ll have had the thought: doesn’t it kinda suck that manufactured homes have looked more or less exactly the same since the 80s? 

That’s the canceled future. In the 40s there was an aesthetic and of course most every decade before that did too — but let’s start there. Jazz and so many different interior designs wikipedia couldn’t keep track. The 50’s had its own distinct from that. The 60’s started a culture so radical it’s still making waves to today and the 70’s built off that. TV’s became a fixture of every household at some point and Vietnam happened and as much as soldiers came back with PTSD the public still thinks of the media from that war with its own trauma all this time later — all you need to do is listen to Rage Against the Machine and you can still feel some of the righteous feelings people had surrounding that time.

Then it starts. The 80’s brought us a plague named Reagan and an agenda we’re still cursed with, neoliberalism… and with those two changes alone, but many others besides to cement it in, corporations took over where humans once had reign and it slowed, it slowly canceled, to where we are now.

Buddhist stagnation. 

 In my lifetime there hasn’t been a revolution like any of those decades brought. Nobody who’s made a whole new taste of music so new and fresh that it's just a separate tongue of taste buds, no.

When corporations call the shots we get Heelys and not Pink Floyds. We get Sexxxy Red not Led Zepplines. Instead of expanding our minds with psychedelics we get Xanax, a drug made by the Chinese to sell to Mexican cartels. My friend said the other day, it’s sad we don’t have heroin on the streets anymore and I almost yelled at him until I realized what he meant: an addict is more likely to get their hands on Fent than they are their old drug of choice, heroine. 

That is sad. And music and drugs are intertwined so rappers, the ones young avid listeners are connecting with, aren’t singing about doing LSD and finding love and breaking hearts. Instead of that we got a whole era of trap music about overpriced skatepark fashion and fast cars and being deadly addicted to prescription pharmaceuticals. Promethazine and codeine — literally cough syrup — mixed with sweets to make some sort of sacred rap elixir, poppin Xannies like candy, football 30 percocets, hydrocodone if you can’t get that. Pharmaceuticals didn’t invade rap music, exactly. It invaded the culture itself, first. 

Doctors still prescribe SSRIs even though there are many studies proving it’s a placebo and all across the medical field practitioners aren’t there to help you anymore, they don’t have a passion for healing others, they just want a paycheck.

Corporations decided to push those SSRIs. 

and people stagnated because there was already so much stagnation and picked an incredibly important profession that they didn’t actually have interest in, all they knew was they had to go to college for something. 

Everyone is burnt out and going to therapy but therapists aren’t equipped to help with life problems, they went to school for psychology. They read studies about how your brain operates, they weren’t taught how to coach someone through… just having an unsatisfying life, really.

This is a microcosm of the overall problem. It all leads back to one thing: get rich and if you’re already rich then get richer. People go on hedonistic, egoistic beings and wonder why their life is so vapid.

. 

Undeniably the world is a better place in 2025 than when I was born in 1997\. Poverty is considerably down and childhood mortality rates as well. World hunger, access to healthcare, and though people like to pretend otherwise, the average age people are buying a house is down and the percentage of people who own property is up as well. 

We have never been better. Really.
