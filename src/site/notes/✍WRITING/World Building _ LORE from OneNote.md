The Age of Myth:  
   
Since the universe could exist it only became a matter of time before it did. It is said that if this universe is to end that that same beginning would necessitate itself once more, and it has been theorized that this exact thing has occurred many times already.  
   
So the universe, now in existence yet empty, created a Mother to birth itself---so that it may experience all that it has. The Mother, often called All-Mother, started backwards---she created many ways that life may itself give life in a begotten never ending cycle. In making everything there is, the Mother had to make ways that it may return to nothing where it came. It is not known why it must return to nothing---but it must, so she birthed the first Gods.  
   
Because of it now existing with form, it necessitates that is also does not. There is a mirror of the universe, identical in all ways---but not. If it exists, that means there must also be the space for it. The mirror is that space. There may be more than one of these mirrors that we are hereto unaware of. They exist independently---but not. Why everything that happens here also happens there---why it acts like a mirror---is unknown. There is no reason why the mirror of our universe, the single one we do know for truth, wouldn't itself have a mirror as well. It may be that the more mirrors down, the more mirrors that are necessitated in a multiplicity. Mirror theorists spectate that four mirrors of mirrors down this line that it no longer acts like the sake of its name and thus mark that boundary as chaos.  
What is already known  
(work up to this point?)  
There are "Gods," and there are demi-gods. And not only that, but theoretically anyone can "mantle" themselves into godhood, as well.  
 

**The Monarchy:**

 

**It is said that after all things were birthed by the All-Mother at the start of all things, after all the gods she made to sow death in her cycles of life, she gave birth to one last thing with the last of her strength: herself.**

 

**But the All-Mother never had corporeal form. Even if she existed, even if she was birthed, she was made, fundamentally, of the same thing an "idea" constitutes. Ethereality. She had made all that existed and then she became the rules, the laws, of which there is no escape, but under which all is fair-game.**

 

**She also became what we might call "spirit," or otherwise any other sixth sense, named now in more professional circles "extra perception."**

 

**Many things are still unexplained. We still have many theories that we assume for truth, but are in essence unverifiable. She is that. She is the glue that combines together any thing that any one might refer to as "gestalt."** 

Observation of our own mirror suggests that the law of entropy as defined in thermodynamics has direct correlation to a mirrors position in this series. Since entropy exists in our own world it is universally agreed that we are, ourselves, a mirror---though, any definition of that position is heavily contested, and remains as a great point of contention in even the most irrelevant of subjects.  
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
Every field from economics to x has some esupposed expert proposit some percieved correlation of outr position in the line of mirrors to some set of data or another that seems potentially significant.  
   
Humanities unwitting legacy:  
   
It all started, as many great things do, quite on accident, while trying to solve a completely different problem. When robots became advanced enough to replicate themselves, we asked how we may make some money from this? An answer was not forthcoming. There was a lucrative, far off, and at the time quite irrational answer, if you could call it that: have these robots make a Dyson Swarm from a base on Mercury. An array of high efficiency, space grade solar panels connected like a capillary network around the sun to harvest its energy. Quite a lot of iron would be needed. And Mercury is made of it.  
   
These same robots planted on Mercury would later become be the basis of the first guardians of humanity and it's most supreme legacy from which dozens of different unique planetary civilizations would in time stem and branch off of.  
   
   
**There would be utopia. It started to coalesce like a temperature sensitive crystallization the same second the last remaining human died, and with it humanity as we understand it**. This was not coincidence, but by design. With humanity out of the way, the robots could create that utopia. The robots were seen able to evolve. The robots, even if they never could fulfill the ambitious Genesis Project laid out by their extinct masters, will one day model themselves into perfect replicas of the same hands that built them. Thus we saw to an immortal legacy.  
   
HUMANITY 2.0 AND THE GOLDEN CYCLE  
   
Just like the start of the universe, because there was an infinite amount of time for the robots, now more aptly called androids, to create the genesis project---so it became only a matter of time before they did perfect it and put the plan into actualization.  
FUCK OFF  
   
   
   
The first Gods as they existed were the size of whole galaxies. It is unlikely they had any "will," not as we know it. They were whole, and they were infallible, and of such power it was beyond comprehension but they were not perfect like the All-Mother that birthed them. The God's were jealous so they broke themselves into many parts in an attempt to make one just as perfect as her image. The remnants, the failures, still plague the stars to this day.
