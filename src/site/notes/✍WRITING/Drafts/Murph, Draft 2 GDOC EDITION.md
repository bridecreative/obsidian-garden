#Import 

One sits upon a rock on the river, contemplation clear across his brow even with his eyes shut. His linen is white and fresh and is dashing by most standards this evening with the sun at his back setting over the cascades. Frogs on the river sing their song and lull him to a snooze as he awaits the second. 

The second resembles the front of a barn. Twice as wide, two heads taller, his arms hairier than the first’s face has ever been. His hand, each finger wide as a sausage, falls gently upon the shoulder of his…

“Cos? Cousin, do you hear?” He gives a shake. 

Sapphire eyes crack open that mend into the deep blue of the late autaum water all around the two. “Claud? Hmm—” 

He seems to not be there.

“Another sleep attack, Mirth?” 

His teeth, white as pearls, are large too. 

“Pray, cos, that I am not called that again\! It’s Murph, and you know.” 

“So you did change your mind.” 

“I came around…”

“Why the sudden change?” 

“The change is for change, cos. I am blue. I need to get lifted out of this rut I’ve made myself.” 

Claud steps away in exaggerated effect, looking the young man up and down. “You say rut, but it looks as though you’ve dug a trench in your despair\!” 

“Which is why I’ll need good medicine. Do you come prepared?” 

“Amply prepared, cos.” 

“Enough for the two of us?” 

The giant of a man fumbles in his pockets. “Have faith.” The corncob pipe he takes out looks like a childrens toy in his hands. 

“Faith is like talk. Cheap.” 

“Talk, like faith, can move the hearts of men when nothing else will.” 

“It will move the man, sure. But is it not the man who did the moving? Is it not his sword or bullet that’ll do the killing? Words rouse him, aye. Yet arousement is a fickle thing…” 

Claud shakes his head several times, slow and deliberate. Exhales a plume of smoke that envelopes the two. 

“What would you believe in then?”

The pipe is handed to Murph. There is a lull, filled with only the ambience of the river and the clouds they exhale. 

“Loyalty,” Murph says suddenly. His voice is unnaturally loud. 

“I thought you’d say respect,” Claud replied. 

“One time I would have. Ever heard the opposite of love is not hate?” 

“No. Frankly, this discussion is already out of my depths.”

“I suppose you wouldn’t care to hear.” Murph looks at the watch on his wrist. “When does the barge come, cos?”

“Soon as the sun has set.” Claud begins to pass the pipe but Murph waves his hand dismissively. 

And the sun was setting rapidly as it was. It was a strange, purple twilight with perhaps ten minutes left of light to walk by. 

“You’ve piqued my curiosity.” Claud says. “Hate and love are not opposite each other, you say?”

“They are very close. It’s why you can so easily despise someone you once kept so close.”

“It would explain why most murders are committed by people you are most close to…” Claud grins and chuckles. “What is it then?” 

“What is what?” 

“Do not close your eyes on me cos\! What is the opposite of love if not hate?”

“It’s not about being opposite in position per say… Indifference. Nothing is further away from either.” 

“She really did a number on you, huh.” 

Murph wipes his hands down his face. “I’ll never be the same, I fear.” And Murph laughs, but not Claude. There was too much truth for it to be funny to Claude. 

“That is why you say loyalty. You’re still loyal to her, and it’s been how many months?” 

“Enough, cousin. Enough.” 

“It just made sense to me at once. In a way few things click. Ah\! The barge.” 

“How are we doing this?” Murph asks.

Claude shrugs. “I’ll give you the larger portion. There’s enough for two people in this container. Do you catch my drift? Find yourself a minx and forget your woes.” 

“What’s the dosage?” 

“They call them four ways, because they break perfectly in fours.” Claude tosses something spherical his way. “Start with half of a fourth. Give it thirty minutes before you say it doesn’t work. Work up from there.” 

It looks like a rubber ball. Murph’s fingernails find the seam and peel it back. He sniffs it, and it smells strongly of Claude’s clongone, oak with moss. Murph holds one out to the dying remains of the day.

“Claude… They call them four ways because they look like a four way window pain.” 

“You're the expert.” 

“That I am. That I am…” 

He carefully pulls off one fourth as if tearing paper and places it under his tongue. It has no taste, which is good, he notes. How it should be. 

“Let it be said that height and weight have nothing to do with a man’s caliber,” Claud says.

“How do you mean, cos?” 

“That amount would incapacitate me.” 

“Oh. I just prefer this type on the heavy handed side. You’ve seen exactly how little of the good leaf I can smoke.” 

“True,” Claude says. He is looking off to the road. Murph’s eyes follow his own on instinct, and he hears what must’ve initially caught his attention. 

A lone rider. 

“Did you invite another?” 

“Aye, I did,” Claude responds. “I didn’t think you’d come. Didn’t think he would either for that matter\!” 

“That’s who I think?”

“There is only one man in this town with jet black hair to his ass.”

“It could still be one of the two women with black hair… No.”

It couldn’t. It was he, and they both know it.

“Don’t delude yourself, Murph. It’s your unbridled honesty that makes you you.”

“I’m surprised you’re acquainted. ” 

“I was about to say the same\!” Claude said. 

“I promise I know more than you.”

“Try me, cos.” 

“His real name isn’t Solomon. He dubbed himself that to seem more biblical… to fit in with the crowd.” 

“

It was as though this man with the pitch hair riding at speed ushered in the night itself. Murph was glued to the riders ever fainting outline which was itself fading just like the purple twilight into night until everything was as black as the rider's hair.

“His real name isn’t actually Solomon,” Murph says, looking back at Claud only long enough to see him rummage through the large messenger bag slung across his shoulder. “He dubbed himself that to seem colloquial. Can you believe that? He’d be less conspicuous if he’d said his name was Daisy Duke\! Solomon…” 

There’s a click of ignition. A lantern starts to hum, sputtering and throwing off light in flickering waves. “Where do you know him from, cos?” 

“Primary. In third grade I think. Special tutoring for our speech patterns or what-not. I couldn’t pronounce ‘are,’ or ‘el’ sounds, and Solomon… I forget why he was there. But he was. And you?”

“I’ve seen him here and there until we’d met by chance enough times that it was no longer chance. He is charismatic once he opens up. Though, it’s hard for me to see him ever needing help with speech.”

“That’s the problem. He’ll have his own cult at this rate.” 

Claud laughs, shaking the only source of lighting. “An apt summary of the problem, cos.” 

“I hate his rhetoric. But it’s amazing, I admit. Here he comes…” 

“Is that Murphy I hear\!” 

“Aye, it’s me\! I see you still have your same sense of timing.”

Out of the darkness emerges more of the stuff. As if he came from a funeral. Claud turns, stealing the light, and begins to flash the lantern closed and shut at an exact interval. 

“I’d say I could’ve paced myself another minute out… No hard feelings between us, I hope?” 

There is the sound of music and a crowd—only faint now, but growing quickly. Murph is glad it’s dark because he cannot contain his chagrin—his face distorted in an awful uncontrollable scowl. 

“We jump,” says Claud. “Be ready when I say go.” 

“Murphy—”

“None,” Murph interrupts. “None at all,” he mutters before turning himself and grabbing his giant cousin's shoulder. Down below—10 feet or so—lies the barge. 

“3…”

Solomon grabs unto the other shoulder of Claud.

“2, 1\!” Claud says in a rapid succession and fills his lungs with air. “Go\!”

\[Move above^ to chapter 1\. Actual start of chapter 2 begins on page break.\]

One lands upon a party-goer, another dangling halfway on and halfway off while clutching their junk. The most unlucky one fell bellyflop in autumn-chilled rapids.

The one in the middle would strongly protest. Solomon would prefer far more cold and deadly waters to the brunt force his twins had just taken if you asked him. He was more or less in paralysis—but not total. He threw down his arms and struggled with his black duster coughing and choking. One leg hanging off the rail of the barge started to sink into water—not that he could tell at that time. By the time it occurred to him that it may matter, his right boot was filling with water and he had no strength left to protest anything, let alone the rapids he too was being pulled into. 

It was no small amount of luck that Claud was the one who landed on the deck—though, the man he fell on thus breaking a full, periousilous impact onto the deck would protest that there was any amount of luck in this situation whatsoever, he wasn’t Murph who was currently drowning. So Claud was surprisingly alert and well and got right up, ignoring that his lantern had broken and that tongues of flame were lapping at his feet all around him. He took a single laser focus step thinking only to save his cousin before he slid across the oil slick poised not unlike a charades player mimicking an ice skater.

As if he had intended for it the whole time, Claud’s panicked outstretched hands wanting to grab onto any near thing they could did in fact find something meaningful to hang onto: the left sleeve of Solomon's duster. 

This was perfectly in time for Solomon’s boot to completely fill and act like an anchor. 

So it was that less than three seconds after crashing the party barge something miraculous occurred. Solomon had only tried to disrobe—gods know why. He’d done a bad job of it as only his left side came off. Solomon sank, but Claud accidentally had a great grip of his left sleeve and the rail underneath it. 

If any of this had happened even a second later Murph would have paid the price in the forfeit of his life.

You might think Murph had been just as lucky as well but from his point of view the last few moments were only one—one in which he was praying to any god who’d listen. He saw it all transfold as if in slow motion and had his hand out waiting right where Solomon’s leg would be a second hence. 

Claud was holding Solomon by his jacket and Murph had such a tight hold of Solomon’s ankle that a scar would remain there till his dying days.

Lucky they may be but even the most optimistic of men had to admit they were still in a ruinous debt. The deck of the barge was ablaze. Chaos amongst the passengers only began more chaos—in the middle of the ship all anyone could feel was a horrible sense of dreadful panic. All passengers voicing all their concerns at once—deafening. 

A single solitary wave of freshwater crashed into them. 

The fire extinguished in an instant and all of the boys were now aboard, the three of them knowing however many coincidences there may have been previously, this was not numbered among them.
