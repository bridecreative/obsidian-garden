## Table of Contents

## Misc. Jot-down
It'd be cool if there was some sort of moon related plot point. Like, spacestation HQ or something. 






My current problems: 
1. Ego fragmentation
	1. How do you write about this?

2. Inability to feel. Physical and emotional.
3. PTSD. *This is haunting the character throughout.*
	1. PTSD from what?
4. Drinking.
5. Previously a cutter. 
	1. Very, very rarely does now but as a symbolic thing. 
	2. Actually likes the sight of blood.
6. Cultural: Has no belonging
	1. Even though they are extremely talented. Their life is ultimately unfulfilled. 
7. Fears the dark



My current goals/strengths:
1. Be a coder.
2. Teacher/professor (think how Indiana Jones is)
	1. "I know the difference between a genius and a genus."
3. Exercise/athlete, a very talented one. Runs the 400m. (!?)
4. Grow mushrooms. (!?) 
	1. "When I was a kid we just found a field with cowshit and after a rain picked up anything fungus lookin'" 
5. Has superhuman intuition. 
	1. Jojo-type cleaver. Doesn't fight so much as she tricks. 



Personality:
1. Polite, kind.
2. Knows how to bite and when.
3. Respected. 
4. Control. Needs control over what’s around them to a fault.

5. Highly symbolic. 
6. 


Background:
>she may be holy, but her parents ain't. 
>her father is ex gang tied. Her mother might be more scary than him. They divorced but still work together in politics after taking a stack of cash and getting into real estate. Big into it, too. 


## PLOT
Notes on Writing a Novel by Tim Rogers
>Chapter 1:   
 In chapter one, we meet the main character. We experience the main character’s “every day” and “one day” in that one chapter. I like to combine “every day” and “one day” \[in the first chapter\]  
 In my opinion, the best way to do this is to start the story cold with the main character doing their job. I want to immediately frustrate my character. From the instant I introduce the character to the reader, I am itching to point the character at something that is different, and see them react to its being different. 
 Then, when the “every day” becomes the “one day”, the transition is enormous and jarring even to our extraordinary character. 
 Chapter one is around 3,000 or 4,000 words. Chapter one is a short story. It absolutely must work taken on its own. 



Day (Question): 1A,  — 2C,  
			      3d, — 4f,   
				      5G,  — 6I
					  g5, h5  — i6
			     D3, E3 — 4F,
Night (Answer):  a1, b1 — c2 



Where you start is where you begin. So chapter 1 and chapter 6 are the same beat, maybe in a different order. Your character is doing X on their everyday. At the end, they *end-up* doing the same shit they were doing when they started. 

Otherwise, it’s driven by causality. Because of this, this happens. The exclusion is chapter 2, where you spend a lot of time learning about the character(s) you meet in chapter 1. 

*It is paramount that the world and person you write about in chapter 1 is self-contained.* This can’t be understated.


Chapter 6 is purely the wind-down, the ending. Chapter 4 is the climax and chapter 5 is close to as action packed as chapter 4.

**1A.** Everyday. Then, you see a fire. You get a call. 

**1B.**  You learn shortly after that it’s your fathers headquarters. You ignore this call to action you learn… Your favorite sibling dies. It was a terrorist attack. She’s the one who raised you, basically. Before your father took over when your mother passed.   

**1C.** 


Introduce yourself:
**2A.** You have to tell Peach about who you truly are. You’re not just another person, you’re someone. You’re the capitalist, oligarch version of royalty. You do this on the way to the church. You’ve tried to get closer to the Gods but you’ve never heard them. Until now.  
	Introduce the rest of the main cast. Also introduce side people, so the reader kind of has to think about who’s important or not.

**2B.** You are making your way into the city which is blockaded by police on one hand and in chaos otherwise.

**2F.** You have to call in heavy artillery. The only person in the family you’re in graces enough to call upon.



**3A.** 

**3B.** You confront your father. It’s a whole ordeal. You ask him, point blank, why he did it. Why he raped you all those years.
>"You look like your mother… she was the only woman I ever loved. That’s it. I had no thoughts more complex than that.” *“I’m going to kill you if it’s the last thing I do—I swear it on my life.”* 
>
>A curse is cast upon him. He grips his chest. “And I believe you—though, it won’t be without a fight, Hollis.”
>

**3C.** After the showdown, your dad metaphorically gives you a gun and a badge. Well, he literally gives you a gun. Something highly illegal. The badge is that your his daughter, you have free access to basically any part of the city. A P.I., of sorts.


**4F.** You throw away your status. You’re just a peasant, essentially. But a really, really rich one. This allows you to take a mantle you couldn’t before, and even though you technically are without high status you obviously have the same sway with the right people. You still have the badge because of your birth and you still have a gun.
