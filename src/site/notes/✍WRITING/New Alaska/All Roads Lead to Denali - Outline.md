## From [[✍WRITING/New Alaska/FROM GDOCS/Cynth Fragments - Ideas, Notes\|Cynth Fragments - Ideas, Notes]]


1. You are doing your everyday. This mostly involves flirting with your limerent love. Then… Your favorite sibling dies. She’s the one who raised you, basically. Before your father took over when your mother passed.   
	   1. **DETAIL.** Your father was madly in love with your mother and thus because you look like her, he molested you in your teen years.   
2. But you only learn this because something, an aberration, tries to assassinate you. You pray as a final resort and the patron blesses you, saving your life barely. *You get cursed in the process.* It’ll eventually give you something like dementia. This is called ‘fragmenting,’ like your ego is shattering. *This forces your hand. Now you must solve a mystery.* As it seems there is no possible way these things aren’t connected.   
	   1. You have a bit of magic yourself just like your grandma did. Your side kick is like Sam in lord of the rings if they were in an intense emotional relationship.  
	   2. Your power is an optical illusion, basically.  
	   3. **MISC.** But as you close in you’re cursed. You’re fragmenting. Your self is divided into two, there’s a tactical you and there's the real you and as you progress the real you further breaks down into a dissociation soup of non-human feelings.

4. Because of this… You have to go even deeper in. Who killed your sister? What is going on in the family since you’ve been gone? Who is telling the truth, and this comes down to why should they even trust you. You start by interviewing the members of the family, one by one.  
	   1. You confront your dad at this point for help. While dissociating, you ask him why he molested you as a teen. And for the first time, he owns up and tells you. He hands you the keys.  
	   2. Guns and magic live side by side. You get a gun and because your father has so much political clout you basically have a badge. Those are the keys.  
	   3. As you leave, you inadvertently curse him. You have no control over your newfound powers. It wasn’t a choice. The Gods did this.   
	   4. You interview a sister. She tells you, you really don’t have a choice if you want to figure this out.  
	   5. **DETAIL.** Your friend is like your dad was, a drug dealer. There is a political fight going on between classes.   
5. Because of that… As you wander the streets with your sidekick friend, you need to pick a side. Toppling the regime seems the smartest decision. You meet up with nearly all your siblings. Nearly. The most important are nowhere to be seen. You start to take on the culture of the weak, the fashion and accent.   
	   1. You become a leader, and you need to be of their same status to do so so your abandon your name and rank in society. This is the only way to take on the political position that will allow you to get the power you need, what amounts to being a representative of the people, basically what once was the house in the senate.  
	   2. Look up the reconstruction. 

7. The first task to block the wave your father sends and you as you instantly become danger to him. You stop his gang by uniting the poor in the name of the Gods. And the Gods answer, maybe to you, maybe to the crowd. But they listen and the wave is stopped, even if it’s not killed.  
	   1. You’re basically a saint of the patron god.   
	   2. Some siblings join the cause after your win. Because of these joining you know exactly where to go next. Process of elimination.   
	3. To proceed, you need to get your hands on metal. Meteorite metal. You make a sword that is basically a wand as well. *How do you get it? Does it come to you?* 

9. Your sister killed herself because it forces this exact hand. She is beloved. One of them challenges you to a duel. Two Gods on your respective side fight for you in this, but you narrowly defeat him and with his support you gain considerable political power and wealth. Those under the upper echelon are on your side in the name of taking out the ruling class, of which your father is a part of.  
	   1. This sibling, the one you hate most, knows some of what killed your sister. He takes you to her grave, a huge tomb, at night. You drink wine together and wonder why you have to hate each other. He shows you the body which is a visceral moment. He proves it, she stabbed herself in the heart.  
	   2. You learn then the truth. This wasn’t murder, it was a calculation. You’re all honour bound to avenge her and you fell right for it. Everyone did.  
10. You leave for a moment. You are basically in a cabin in the woods. Your hand was forced. You are losing your sense of self.  
	   1. Based on hints throughout, you figure out who the witch is that cursed you. The final sibling you haven’t seen. The only way to lift the curse, you’ve known since the beginning, is to kill them. And you need to make that choice. You can live as a split person, a genius who takes your fathers spot. Or you can kill your sibling, you can go back to a normal life.  
	   2. But she forces your hand. She kills herself the same way Piety did.   
	   3. You now have to start where you did.

11. In the name of the Gods you start a revolution. It’s called the Rejuvenation. Someone created a cocktail that makes people Berserk. The people are ready to die for the cause. The elites are not.  
12. The revolution is already in motion, you can’t stop it. They played you. You start where you begin.  
    1. You see your father die. You hear his last words. I heard your curse upon me the whole way.   
    2. The Gods take their rightful place upon the throne. A democracy is overthrown, a democracy starts. The House is restored and the Senate is replaced with elected officials. You’re offered the spot. You deny it and recommend someone else. The brother you hate so much becomes president in your stead.  
    3. You're back where you started. The same place with a different person.

### Example
**Ex. from Jammey Infames**
>*James/Jammey “Dexicode” Monikel* — Modeled after myself. Is transgender. Has demons, and PTSD, and sleep paralysis demons — and “some sort of mood disorder.” Phobia of dark skies. Sometimes she doesn’t take her meds.   
>Traits: Obsessive. Intense. Type-A. Often highly escalating—shoot first, ask questions never. Then shoot again. Addicted to pharmaceuticals. Makes them, too. Or, once did.
>

**Breakdown**
>A graphic designer that is laying low because their main job, involving having a background as a lawyer, was to make a drug in a think-tank to see if they could control culture would work… which it did. 
>1. *Background as lawyer*
>2. *Worked at Think Tank*
	1. Created a culture-changing drug there that infected popular culture.
	2. Got heat.
>1. Thus, became *graphic designer.*
>   
>They moved from California, their home, to Alaska — where her long time love was born. They moved there together. She is trans, has that same love mentioned that she’s still madly in love with. He has a kid who she still considers her own. They can’t be together because they were in a open relationship and he knocked up his ex-gf in what was probably a baby-trap.
>

Your character needs to be this complex.

*Who do you have to be?*
1. You have PTSD and likely a mood disorder. 
	- PTSD from what?

Start: 
1. The blaze that is the middle of Jammey Inflames is where you start.
	1. Your favorite sibling dies in the fire.
	2. Thus starts a quest of revenge.

2. God gives you a curse. A time limit. You begin to fragment.
	1. It’s called ‘a blessing.’ God doesn’t curse. It’s your trial.
	2. This gives you a new found intelligence. You're basically Philip Marlow. 

*Relations:*
Limerent love - you call him Peach. He’s basically a greaser. 

You live near Anchorage. You’re part of a influential family. One that's being targeted by terrorists. 

"the rich always win, the poor always lose."


## PLOT


Day (Question): 1A,  — 2C,  
			      3d, — 4f,   
				      5G,  — 6I
					  g5, h5  — i6
			     D3, E3 — 4F,
Night (Answer):  a1, b1 — c2 


You are tending to your mushrooms. This is your job. You eat a mushroom and start tripping. Humming in a harmony, your "friend" Peach comes over. You hold his hand. It feels like ecstasy. 
	Call to action: there is an explosion. You dislike the location it looks to be at. A sniper tries to kill you. At wits end, you pray. Your foot is taken from you, it blackens and withers to chunks like activated charcoal before flying off. There's a scream. The pain of it makes your personality split. Slowly, the fragments of your leg return to you. Until it's all there, Peach supports you. 

The whole horizon is red flame. You know it's your father's headquarters. 

You refuse the call to action. You'll just live with it. Then you learn your favorite sibling died and your forced, you have no choice in your head. 



















*Each chapter is written by one of the characters.*

There is no paradise. All you'll ever find is just a different battlefield with the same people going by different names.”

Politics are very important

Class divide is the main sticking point

The United States but ununited. Fiefdoms. 

Multiple plotlines that meet together. Crimes aren’t random.

Five(?) stage act

Game of Thrones but you turn the throne into a democracy. 

Trump becomes the start of a king ship. The democracy is just a face, the president rules. The senate is just the richest most politically powerful people (your dad is apart of and you are almost at by virtue of being his daughter) and you're restoring what once was. An actual democracy again. The United States is mostly just composed of the weakest states, the biggest ones are for all intents independent countries.
