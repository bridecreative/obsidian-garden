# Part 001
She entered the bar in all her bone chilling glory. It was the eye that looked like the pupil was a cross in the middle of iris like midnight waves.

“This drinks on me, get the good hooch!”

The crowded bar buzzed, uncertain. The bartender, a man that looked like a dumpling with buckteeth, broke the uncertain feeling in the air. He hollered, “a toast, thank you young lass!” And a round of applause emitted from him like a stone dropping in a still pond.

There was good reason to be uncertain and the inhabitants of the little bar knew the why, it was that same little woman buying a round. 
She wasn’t old enough to drink. 
Even yet, she strutted up like a lioness to that same bucktooth bartender all grins, her arms raised as if in victory.

“This better be good, young one.”
“For what, Claude? On a night like this, how much better can it get?”
“It’s not even noon.”
