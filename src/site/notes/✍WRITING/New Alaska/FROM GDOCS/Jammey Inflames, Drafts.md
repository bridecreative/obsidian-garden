## `Prelude, Draft ALPHA “Inflames”` {#prelude,-draft-alpha-“inflames”}

Just like Athenni being born from the mind of Zues, I too came from a thought. Someone — dead now — conceived in their head: “maybe I’m trans.” Then a new person came from that. There was a painful, years long metamorphosis. It was as beautiful as it was cruel. When a caterpillar becomes a butterfly they turn into a goo, did you know that? They crystallize. 

I realize I’m thinking, not talking. I’m looking deeply into the eyes of someone. Take’s me a moment. It’s Togame. Well, that’s a relief. I hate it when I stare long into the soul of someone I don’t know well. I think I’m blinking — or maybe trying. Her hand smoothly glides into mine and holds it up in hers and it feels like I could laugh and cry at once at that feeling alone. Her smile, showing her lil’ crows feet, only heightens my intoxication. The contact of our palms and fingers gently nested in each other is better than any sex I’ve ever had.

She’s a hand holder. It’s her most enduring trait. She’s made of enduring traits. I think even the quality of her hair being so black — so black it’s like neon attraction — so black as to suck in surrounding light — is just another enduring part of her, too. One time she tried to explain how she makes it shine and flow like it does. I started to get a rare migraine. Maybe that’s why I obsess over her — she is my twisted little project of one part passion two parts incessant need of emotional reciprocation. Our love is as artificial as it is twisted. I doubt she knows. She could. Her huge pupils remind me of river rapids reflecting moonlight. She is a river—she flows whereas I’m rigid. She’s everything I’m not. The missing puzzle piece to my soul.

There’s some music that should be loud playing low—somebody, here now, made it doubtlessly. String lights of orangish light LEDs banner across the room. Something compels me to scan further. The whole apartment is, basically, a shipping crate that goes on a cargo ship. Thus the moniker for this place is sunken sea compartments. 

But it’s homely, nicely decorated, lights dimmed just so, and all across the room are various other ultra independent and type-a or otherwise huge radicals, big names of some sort looking into each other with equal zeal and love. It’s unbelievable. I’ve been to plenty of parties but the atmosphere here is electric beyond words and I’d give it maybe five minutes at most before some couple starts fornication across some furniture or wall or such.

“Will you walk with me?” It’s a plea, not a question. It’s beyond need—she might die if she doesn’t walk right this instant. And I take her hand still in mine and find my footing for us, leading her by the hand out of the room.

The hallway seems inhospitable compared to the lively mood inside. Quite—too. You can hear the sanitary white fluorescent bulbs hum. I quickly make my way upstairs to the borrows opening, where we can make our escape into moonlight. The flight up to the maw feels like it leads to something greater than me, a stairway to heaven, but we do finally emerge in a little hut of a reception room with two automatically locking doors that leads down to the sunken compartments below. Windows are open. The night breeze and warm temperature is the good kind of sweat—I feel alive. I open the door to outside.

The new, artificial moon hangs proud and high in this starless spot of the world next to the old moon of rock — a waning crescent, now. The borealis is dancing like two ballerinas tonight. Mom said we didn’t always rise with the moon. I can’t imagine waking up to look at anything else.

Togame starts sucking on a little pod—she’s been cradling it in her hand all night. It is a tight black dress kind of night— “Want some?” Vapor plums exhale with every syllable. I wish I could get away with wearing dresses like that.

I shake my head. Oddly, I want her lips. I want to tell her — forget vapor, let me feel your skin on mine. She probably would. But that would ruin the delicate emotional reciprocation I tirelessly tend to between us which scares me from saying anything at all.

You guys go out and walk in pregnant silence until you get above the world and overlook the Fairyring and the overall town / community besides. You see—stretching across the horizon. Only huge plumes of smoke. And you know it was your handy work.

## `Chapter 1.0, Draft 1.01 “James”` {#chapter-1.0,-draft-1.01-“james”}

The morning starts with the usual routine. Suddenly they were asleep then awake. Then there is no more blessid sleep—not until it’s due time in the night, according to the routine. The first thing one does when they wake is take 100mg of Modafinil—it’s like 600mg of caffeine that lasts for 12 hours and doesn’t have a crash. “Smart drug,” they call it. Must be smart to take it. 

The next pills are somewhat smart, too. Ashwagandha, 8000mg. They fumble with bottles leaning over from their bed, dishing out pills. It’s part of eastern medicine. They’re not eastern, only medicine, so they don’t know why it’s clever—but it’s about as efficient as klonopin, they think. The modafinil gives an adverse histamine effect like having mild arthritis so they take 20mg of zyrtec here as well and wash it all down with a big glass of water always prepared on the nightstand. 

All the other drugs on the small nightstand, so many they nearly pile up in a hoard, are left untouched. 

They're off the meds again… Watch out\! 

They should be taking a plethora of things, mood stabilizers, an atypical antipsychotic, anxiety medicine(s) that don’t work. They are practically a walking pharmacy, and right now that pharmacy isn’t serving its one, sole patient.

On the way to the sitting, shining white vanity—stretches. Nothing so refined as—aerobics. The crude, warm up kind. Like for a morning jog. 

Sitting. Clearing the throat — *ahem*. Brushing wavy auburn brown hair going well below the shoulders. They take a moment to try and appreciate what stares back. It doesn’t usually work, but they always try. It’s part of the routine, “appreciate yourself.” Then they stare a bit longer. There’s something missing.

That face. A hand reaches up in the mirror and it touches where my face should be—but I’m not there, that’s not me. Is it. Me? 

It is. I can’t recognize my face.

I go back to the medicine hoard. What the fuck do you even take for this again? Naltrexone—that’s a good start. Impulsivity must be curbed — especially when impulses now are mostly about effective ways to harm yourself. 

They shake out four pills of klonopin and take them dry, even chewing into one and it’s numbing mint that tastes of relief. Sooner the better with that one. They look at their hands—at mine. Me. I begin to tap with my finger tips rhythmically on the meridians of my skull. The temple, then brow, each time I tap one time more than the last. Tapping the cheek bone, either side, and down the meridians that make up me. 

Chin, upper lip, down to just below the collar bone. *Tap, tap, tap.*

Deep breathes. I think with each tap reinforcing as if fingers are the hammer hitting anvil: “I am okay.” *Even if it’s not true,* I note, from somewhere nagging. But this truth feels all the better. 

I breathe—and I can feel it’s my own breath this time. *This is dissociation.* 

A stare, long and cold at a bottle I know holds antipsychotics. I will not touch the bottle, I know. Though—at this point. I also know I should. I should. I know. The bottle dissipates and my focus blurs from looking at the bottle as I get deeper into the labyrinth of mirrors that I call my mind. 

It’ll take days to find my way back out—I know this too. I didn’t stay in dissociate-land long enough to gauge how bad it was exactly—but not recognizing your own face. Pretty severe, that… I’m scared to check the mirror again. 

Better off getting to work for the day. 

I go past the vanity to another place to sit, this a huge hard wood desk. Looks like it could be oak, in another life. Could have been a hundred things. Now it sits here, huge and heavy and imposing on its space. The wooden equivalent of a rusted out car. I flip open the case of my laptop and press a button indicating power then pass by into the darker spot of my flat, flipping on a light as I walk seamlessly into the kitchen.

Carefully I delegate out enough water and coffee grounds for my expresso. Empty the old into recycling. I take moments here to breathe—to be present. To feel as my body moves, and it’s a blessing that it is moving and that I can breathe and be here now. I start to enjoy it, this joyless act. 

This routine. Stick to the routine. 

I bring steaming black coffee back to the nameless artifact of a desk and sit in the opposing, imposing, black Herrman Miller. Typing in username and password, I log on for the day which won’t be ending for some ten hours. Sometimes the best medicine is to get your head into another space. Especially when the symptom and cause of your concern is just a state of mind.

I open an inconspicuous drawer. It’s the jackpot. That’s what I call it—this drawer. It is a jackpot for the right person. A plethora of substances, a veritable paraphernalia of them, stare back at me in their little identical plastic baggies and jars. I reach in and fish out a mason jar. It’s filled to brimming with clear pills of finely grounded greenish gray powder—psilocybin. The dose is small—and that’s the point. I take one with steaming espresso. 

Adjusting myself into the chair that somehow remembers the shape of me—the day starts with checking email. There are two. One is—email. The same that’s been used since forever. The other is self-deleting, everything about it self-destructive and temporary and highly encrypted with the only permanence to it being the actual address itself. 

## `Chapter 1.3, Draft 1.02 “James PT.2”` {#chapter-1.3,-draft-1.02-“james-pt.2”}

The alphabet I know intimately begins to look like ancient, unknowable hieroglyphics. There, “D E A R   J A M E S,” it begins, and I’m lost. What does that even mean? D-Ear? The letter ‘d’? It flashes out at the bottom of my eyelids like subtitles. D. E. E. A. R. R. R… They won’t stop repeating, scrolling by. Not even when I close my eyes. Am I being invited to a hunt? But I’m a pescetarian. Are you my husband, ‘dear’? I search the screen to find the sender. 

I can’t. Everything is smearing like blood. 

I reach for my over ear headphones — they are so expensive, it costs me money every time I simply glance at them. “Opensesame,” I say. A little beep is sent as feedback to say ‘I’m listening.’ I say, leaning back in my luxurious Herrman Miller as far as it will let me while I clutch my headphones to my ears. “Play the dissociative playlist and dial the mood lighting.” I close my eyes and prepare myself. Whatever loud noise I call music that begins playing grounds me with every unharmonious string of glitched tempo. It probably sounds like how I feel. A broken record. 

I squeeze my eyelids tighter. I realize time is a construct as much as a caste system is. I see a wispy thread of a link in the dark of my mind and pull on it. I’m talking to something now, a hold of the taught line like moonlight manifest leading somewhere far above me. I say, ‘God, help me.’ And my eyes open. An intrusion is waving. When did I open them, I want to ask. It’s made of flesh, the oscillating, snapping slender digits. I resist the urge to close my eyes and instead dart them to whatever body the offending appendage is attached to.

I neatly place the headphones onto my lap. You can still hear the music faintly coming from them, glitching, breaking. I clear my throat — *ahem.* I remain reclined so as to not seem as nonplus as I am. *Ahem, ahem,* I go.

“You don’t look too hot auntie.” 

The boy in front of her has a real nice shiner—black and blue. On the left eye. “I could say the same,” she feels herself saying. He is pacing around. He is not the kind of boy to pace around for no reason, not the kind to look so anxious. “What’s happening?” She managed. She reaches for espresso. She isn’t sure if she is nonplus or nonexistent. 

“Dad’s been gone. Ten weeks,” he says. He stops to inspect her face for response. 

I’m spitting out cold coffee. Cold? I check the hour in the bottom of my computer screen like another reflex. 1000h. It’s been three hours since this morning when I woke up. I resist the urge to show any panic in front of my child—stepchild—ex-stepchild. I say instead, “be a dear, and find in that pile the bottle that says ‘amphetamines?’ It might say salts, or XR, or some such.” 

The moment he turns around I blanche, pivoting my face away on my elbow. I can feel the color drain from me and not want to return. Ten weeks?

Ten? 

Why is he *here?*

*Why not come sooner…* 

“Could you turn your lighting off.” Stars made of red and orange orbiting around comets of blue dance across the rooms walls like a disco ball. “It feels like a meteor is falling out of the sky—and it already feels like the end of the world for me,” he says almost like an aside. 

Just like his dad would say it. The cadence and tone, the faint sarcasm and all.

I suppress saying anything and turn to my screen, navigating through a menu. Click a few buttons. Everything dims to a warm 60 watt fluorescent. “Sorry,” I say, unsure what else to say. When I turn back, the boy turns a bottle around, inspecting it, then shakes it. It’s full—he was hearing how full it was. He tosses it underhand to me.

Which I catch. I’m struck for a moment—I hadn’t the time to realize, but.

He isn’t much of a boy anymore, is he? 

I tilt my head like that’ll give insight. He mirrors me—he is looking back, inspecting as much as I am. No, not even when he was a boy was he a boy—the kid had his life more planned out when he was 11 than most people do when 21 years of age. If he was ever a child, it was only in appearance, and in appearance now he is… his father. Handsome, in a word. High cheekbones, but a pretty chin. They betray his deep, threatening deep blue eyes that are a step away from being gray. Those are from his mother. His hair is darker now, not so blonde—a very mature color. I don’t know who he got that from.

I can’t even say ‘boy’ in jest anymore—“how old are you now?” I blurt out.

“It’s been a few years, hasn’t it,” he says. It’s not a question, I note. I unscrew the bottle and dish out a heavy dose. “I’m seventeen now, auntie... That’s a lot you’re taking?”

He sounds—hesitant. Worried? “Wait. Why do you know Adderall dosage?” 

But this is like asking why a baby knows to suck it’s mothers teet. 

Apple doesn’t fall far from the tree. Dad is a world renown investigator, afterall. And he responds like one. A shrug, as he glances at my response—I find myself betraying none. He begins a slow, meandering pace, doing a slow half circle around where I sit, looking at my floor boards like they're intricate and fascinating. He is in a zone. He is bidding something—something to say, or pounce on once said.

“Spit it out,” I say. “Tell me everything.”

He doesn’t look from the wood floors, but he tilts his head in this way that I won’t forget, because I’d seen it a thousand times before—just not on him.

“I was here—hoping you’d have something to say to me.”

He is gritting his teeth. He is at a loss. 

That is why he is here.

And he looks like what he is, for once—a kid. A kid looking for any thread of hope to cling onto, that is what he seeks here, why he seems to bid.

“Sit,” I point. He looks bewildered. That’s probably what I looked like, trying to understand the etymology of dear. “The vanity, child.” 

I snap and he obeys his way to the lumbar-supportless white stool sitting profile to  a glazed over white framed vanity. I chug the rest of the cold espresso with the admittedly large dose of amphetamine.

Leaning over him on the stool, I tap a textiled left corner of the mirror and it turns on, now reflecting like mirrors do. I tap three times and all the many lights turn on lining the top of in an attempt to imitate direct sunlight. 

“Jesus H,” he squints.  

“Beauty is pain,” I say. Trying to think of who always said that to me as a kid, I open a drawer and sort through make up pouches. 

“Aren’t you gonna… say something?” He says. “Like, how’d I get in?”

“No, Paris. I’m waiting.”

“For?”

“For wherever you choose to begin.”

## `Chapter 1.5 Draft 1.03 “Childe Paris Tells All”` {#chapter-1.5-draft-1.03-“childe-paris-tells-all”}

Dad left and mom went on a bender the moment the door closed. When? I don’t know—May 2nd. Maybe the 3rd. You know mom—it quickly got out of hand. And—it’s not unlike her to do this, though it’d been a long time sober this time around. And dad—he’s always leaving. Not even he knows where he's going half the time, just which plane to get on and when. 

Well two weeks turn to four… 

You know why I didn’t call him. Mom was deep in it. I didn’t want to be the herald of this bad relapse. Still—four weeks was a long time. No word. Not unheard of though—so I still wasn’t too worried. Then mom let the house become a den. People always in and out. I didn’t like it… which is why you’re putting makeup on me now…

How's mom? She’s completely lost in it. I’m not even sure on what this time. I’ve seen her nod off and tweak out but this is like… banging into walls. 

I guess I’m skipping around. Five weeks in, I finally called him—disconnected, maybe phone was turned off. I don’t know. Work said they ‘couldn’t say anything about his condition.’ Seems like an odd choice of words. Mom is, funny enough, the last person to see him. … — It’s funny because who knows if she even did—she’s out of her mind right now. She sees a lot of shit that isn’t there, remembers things that never happened. 

What else? What do you mean, what else? Seventeen year olds don’t hold shit for weight. I’ve been mostly taking care of my mom and the house—or trying.

He goes to reach for his black eye where freshly laid makeup was put on to conceal and she swats his hand like it’s a housefly. “It’s perfect,” she says. “Don’t touch.” To answer, he inspects himself in that imitation of sunlight, that reflection of himself, turning his head this way and that. 

The wise if young man nods in approval, “it’s almost impossible for me to even tell I’m wearing makeup.” He turns to her. He need not say it, his eyes do for him. ‘Now what do you intend?’ He understands on some level that he’s put himself in her hands. It’s the moment of truth.

“You need to check my email.”

“Come again.” 

“Not just any email. Emails with information so sensitive it could put peoples lives in risk and end careers in an instant.”

“Why.”

A poignant question. They stand there and it’s technically silent between them in that room but her eyes seem to buzz loudly like with electricity, throwing off sparks.

Paris puts up his hands like being held at gunpoint. “Fine… but like, are you okay?” 

His head inclines back as it tilts no more than a fifth of a degree, looking up at her. They remember a warm winter night like all nights are in California, their place of birth and where they used to call home and represent proudly besides. The first time that boy's father came to visit James, and they said I love you—the first time that would mark the start of much other love and meaningful I love yous thereafter. And he, the father of the son, did that same thing, then. Tilt the head almost infinitesimal before looking down in thought as Paris imitates now. 

Strange things are heritable, she concludes. She can feel her veins constricting from the stimulant. Her breath feels more real… — and I grab my index finger counting to five as I exhale my lungs out. “Yeah,” my voice sounds strange to my own ears. I grab the middle finger and count, repeating my exhume of lungs. 

“It’s just really, really bad dissociation.” 

I note, somewhere at the forefront of my temporal lobe, that today is a bad day, as if that’ll change something. The thought, so central, is a switch in a circuit board that leads to nowhere but meant to look important.

“Why do you dissociate auntie.”

Why don’t I, I want to say. It’s all I know—I think of saying that, too. 

“I’m likely prone to it. Narcolepsy. Then… PTSD doesn’t help it.” 

Is he old enough to hear this now? I search his face. His eyes betray intelligence beyond their years. Mine did too, when I was seventeen—didn’t they? I haven’t seen him in years—and time has done as it will, change him as it does all things. Time treated him well, even. 

I wonder how I look to him.

It’s like he’s nodding—but does he comprehend?

“You have narcolepsy?”

Am I… Coddling what he can grasp?

“I—do. Yes. I just have gone out of my way to not get it diagnosed. They’d take my pilot license away if they knew.” 

“Huh. Sounds dangerous. Okay, you need me to check email, huh?”

“Top secret email. Don’t roll your eyes at this\! Sit in the Herrman Miller.”

“You still have this ancient desk\! How’d you move it here? *Why* move it here…”

“I’m not even sure where I found it anymore. A thrift shop? I just like it, okay.”

“You could have told me it was used by a European King during a World War and I’d believe you.” The kid feels it’s sides. He looked up to me, scooted up to the desk and I see six years past. I was at this exact angle then too and I walked up, but he had headphones on... “I used to sit here… after school.” And he looks to me from sitting in my chair just like back then and right now I don’t see Paris in the present, but Paris back then. “Remember?” A boy who knew only love. My boy, and responsibility, back then…

“I couldn’t forget for all the world.” Not that time in my life, no… “Not even if I lived for three hundred years.”

His attention turns to the screen again, a movement I hadn’t known was burned into my memory. “I was a brat,” he states. Was his voice always so deep?

“You were.” You were my brat during that time, though. I can’t say that, I feel. I instinctively reach up to touch a tear duct. “Do you see it? ‘@Neuron.IM’ it’s called.” 

“It’s up. ‘Dear James,’” Paris begins.

“From?”

“Uh. *Dick,*” incredulity creeps into his voice. *“Dick McMann?*”

Another time is forced upon me, this over ten years ago now but vibrant now like yesterday. I see myself talking with a group on the edge of a ballroom floor on the 60th floor, a man's hand reaching out to mine under slow and moody blue and purple slow dance lighting and slower music still. The hand of a towering man—almost too pretty to call handsome, but too handsome to call pretty. He’s bald, that’s all I’d been told about him back then, but they didn’t mention that he wears a fine fitting wig to events—he likes to blend in. I don’t think anyone knew he owned the building. His face is shockingly strong for being so delicate and has many old scars all across that he wears like a soldier does medals. As we danced, he whispered what he’d like to do to me. A polite and forward invitation for dominion, if that sounded okay? I remember his imposing contour turn silhouette from the bathroom light behind him in a suite not fifteen minutes later. I can still feel the muscles of his back ripple as he laid over me. I suggested he look into penis reduction surgery once, and he laughed in agreement, but said, then I wouldn’t live up to my name, now would I? And I laughed then.

“Oh. Uh. Are you sure?” 

“I’m sure,” Paris confirms. “Do you think it’s probably a prank?”

“Read it… Carefully.”

“‘Dear James,” *ahem.* “I’ll know you remember me because few days go by when I don’t think of you.”

“Stop\!”

Paris throws out an arm to stave me away, which unfortunately works. He wears a grin that can only be called shit eating, reciting, “there are few days that go by when I don’t think of our promise\!”

It was cloudless that day. I wore huge gold rim aviators and a wide sunhat. Back then I remember my hair was short and I kept it straight as bone as if it was part of my religion. I kept under trees as I walked like how a child tries not to step on the cracks of the sidewalk, doing a slight zigzag on the park path. His imposing figure was following me, or trying. We sat at the coffee shop, finally inside and safe from the open sky, and he apologized immediately. I don’t think I’d heard him apologize before or since. Said, you tried telling me… Was it that bad, I asked. I was dissociating, something few people get to be able to tell at a glance. He could. And he looked out the window, his arms crossed. Yeah… Yeah, that was bad, he said. I didn’t feel like I was in reality, but a convincing mirror world I’d fabricated. I reached out and felt his forearm just below his watch, but I was far away from there and he knew it. Got a dream, James? I shook my head, no. No, I have principles. He asked me what that was like and I found I was smiling. 

“What promise?”

“Just read the rest of it,” I sighed. I couldn’t tell where I was in the room now.

“No, that’s it. There’s a link, it goes to a contract, it looks like.”

I keep my eyes closed. “Contract?” I’m guessing I found my bed. I’m lying down, at least. 

“NDA, yeah.” 

“Just to talk?”

“Seems that way.”

“Sign it for me. At the bottom, it will have a spot like ‘signature.’ Put my name. Then it’ll say… I don’t know exactly, like, ‘executor,’ or something. Put your name there.”

“Can I do that.”

I close my eyes tighter, adjust myself. “Yes…” and I find a soft blanket, pulling it up and around me. “Yes. If I say… Okay. You’re now officially my legal assistant… I’ll put you on a payroll tomorrow through the LLC.” 

“Huh.”

“I’m gonna work you to the bone. It’s true. Starting now. Figure out how to sign it.” I point where I know my bookshelf is. “There’s legal textbooks over yonder.”

“Auntie.”

“Yes?”

“You’re so fucking weird.”

I know, my sweet child Paris. “I know…”

I close my eyes a second time and enter directly into REM sleep.

## `Chapter 2.0 Draft 1.00 PART C1` {#chapter-2.0-draft-1.00-part-c1}

I can still hear the cocking of the shotgun, a crude sawed off affair hidden under a XL jacket and hanging from a leather strap on the shoulder. I was back, looking into the eyes of McMann at the coffee shop and I knew the question was still put to me though I was no longer smiling. I could still see him swing up the gun so vividly. Blast after blast reverberated through my body and made my skin crawl. McMann was waiting. I said my principles are to leave the world a better place than I found it. A charming smirk. That’s all? Someone outside holding their guts in with their hands runs into the window pane of this little kickback, blood and viseria smear across the window. Screams and whimpers I couldn’t unhear while shots continue. A server sets down our coffees. I look back at him. His facial features are shifting around. I say, for all the bad in the world if I ever get the chance I’ll change it all and bring us back to Arcadia. I can live with that, his lips say, inching away. His floating eyes and brows seem impressed, the disconnected head nodding several feet away from his body. And is that why you get out of bed? 

For just the chance…

“Auntie? Auntie J? You were having a nightmare.” 

“How could you tell.”

“Uh. You just can. See? Your forehead is soaked.” 

I sit up.

“*You’re soaked”* he corrects. 

I raise my arms and they stick to me. “I need you to turn around or leave into the hall. I gotta dress.” I want to shower, my shirt is gonna peel off, but I doubt time permits… “How long has it been?”

“Like, an hour, hour half? I penciled in a schedule. I responded to your emails, told inquiries you were on vacay, told active clients there was…” He fully stops. His mouth is opening and closing. The words won’t come out.

“What is it?”

He sits down in the black Herman Miller and swivels away from me, saying, “That you’re having… a family emergency.”

I wish I could feel right now. That should touch my heart. “You said the right thing,” I find myself saying, as if out of my control. “You’ll always be dear as family to me.”

“Auntie?”

“Yes?”

“Thanks for helping me.”

“Thanks for trusting me, little one.” 

Oops. I swear under my breath.

“I was wondering if you’d still call me that,” he laughs. It’s a wonderful, joyous laugh filled with relief. “It’s good to know some things don’t change.” 

He means it. He can’t hide his genuine enthusiasm—and it’s charming in a way I’m used to. “Mini-me,” I whisper under my breath. “If you were anymore like your dad you would be a clone.” 

He laughs. “Sometimes mom says he gave virgin birth to me all by himself.” 

Yeah… hopefully Paris never inherits the self centered part of Vale, that’s the joke of it. He’s as saintly as Mary. I shake my head… “What were we talking about?”

“Today, at four, you have one appointment. McMann. I scheduled everything else over the next week, tentatively, because McMann said this could go into the night…”

“You talked to Dick? Directly?”

“Yeah. I signed the thing. It signed me in automatically. Suddenly I was chatting. Said I was a legal assistant—he saw through it immediately, somehow?” 

“Yeah. Legal assistant could be anything. Some legal assistants do janitor work and fetch coffees. So—”

“No… I mean, he guessed I was Dad. I told him the truth, since he was so close… I hope he’s a friend?”

“More than that.”

“I figured. He said he was a friend. Okay. Well. You have till four. Four sharp he said, and he was *very* clear about the sharp part.”

“When Dick says to be somewhere sharp it means get here yesterday running at 120%. Don’t look,” I say. Turning my back to him I peel off the sweat soaked shirt and throw it to the ground. I unfold ironed linen in a brown gray, a bit loose fitting, hiding my body's form—yet natural.

I’m not changing out of my yoga pants because when Dick says it’s going into the night it’s actually 48 hours of straight heat. Comfort over style, I don’t care if I look like a sore thumb… wait. 

I look at Paris. “You’ll be my prop.”

“Come again?”

“You’re coming with—you are my legal assistant, nothing strange there. Ever wear a suit? Keep your back straight for me…” 

“Wait—what do you plan, now?”

“You need to look really good so I can look like this. Plus, you might learn something…” I shrug, but if he talked to McMann, my indifference is…

“Fine,” he feigns. 

It’s a bad feint. I’ll have to teach him better than that.

Hook, line, sinker. He barely needed a nudge, the mystery of what’s going on is running at its height—I know because I feel it, myself. Something occurs to me.

“I should warn you, Paris.”

“What?”

“If you come—it’ll forever change your life. It’s very likely. If it’s what I think—nothing will be the same after you leave that meeting with me. I’m serious.”

He feels his face, running from his cheek up above his brow, his hand covering his eyes now. Stressed, that’s what this is. Of course he’s stressed—but it catches me off guard.

“All the more reason to go…”

I clap my hands together. “First thing first, get you dressed to the nines. That won’t take too long… Then, and put this in the schedule: sort out Emily—I mean, your house, uh, situation.”

Aggressive confusion written into the crease of his forehead.

“How do you think you can do that?”

## `C2 Draft 1.00` {#c2-draft-1.00}

He was dressed so well it made the corporate suits type that’ll be there seem like they were wearing rag robes. It was this deep blue matched with light hues of the same as accent that made his eyes pop. His posture was immaculate. Must’ve gotten that from Emily, Vale was always slumped and laying his feet on the nearest furniture…

“Why are you staring at me.”

“I’m admiring,” I said. I handed him my messenger bag. “You're in charge of this. If you ever get caught with it, say you're just a legal assistant and that you are taking it to your boss. Make sure to mention my name.” He put it over his shoulder with some hesitation.

Smart kid. Good instinct, there.

“Do you hold that much weight?” He peered inside. “This is a laptop… Tablet. And drugs. That’s it? I see why you said to blame it on you.”

“Everything in there is legal,” I lied. “It’s all prescribed to me. Don’t worry, I wouldn’t put you in trouble. And yes. I carry considerable clout. Use my name loudly and often.”

“Dad says the same thing… Never have. Never had the chance, though.”

“You’ll get the chance finally. If you want to get out of trouble, use my name and if you want to intimidate, use his.”

“Duly noted. Was the chauffeur necessary?”

“It was on Dick. He doesn’t cut corners. Not for me, at least.” 

“Who is he to you?”

“You feign ignorance too badly to tell.”

“Whaaat?” 

“He is… about what Vale meant to me, but in a different way. Does that give you an idea?”

“You were married to Dad. Or engaged? How is that possible.”

“Use your imagination,” I say. I’m looking at the city streets pass by.

“Really? It was like that?”

“I don’t recommend my lifestyle. Nor would your Dad. It’s more intense than anyone should be able to handle for more than three days. We lived it, though.” 

Thrived in it, really. The more intense the better. We were a fish who could only live in liquified chaos. Probably shouldn’t tell him that part. Open relationships just fit that, maybe. Maybe we needed time alone from each other. And a lot of rough sex with our friends.

“You won’t have to feign. He’ll never tell you. I’m not even sure why I’m telling you, honestly.” That was a lie too. I wanted him to know. He deserves the truth of it if anyone does. It’s part of our legacy which will never be public but maybe a myth in certain circles.

Someones gotta carry on our story. 

“What else was intense about it?” Incredulous again. 

“When I did work in law, it was partly a front for drugs. And I made them.”

“Come again.” 

“That’s why we moved here. Or, again, in part. Too much heat in California. All I really did was make a mixture of existing drugs and a way of delivery. It was the ratio, the safe administration. It cut down a lot of overdoses but got people their fix or fun. Its addiction rate is relatively low. We called it Elixer, then. It goes by a hundred others, now.”

“You made that.”

“It was sort of a test. How much can you influence something completely illicit?” I turn to him. He’s absorbing this like a sponge. “It was very successful. Too successful. We made a whole movement and it was completely fabricated. It became international quite by accident.”

“I’ve got a few questions…” Paris trailed off. “My mom does Elixir. How did you do that?”

“She does Elixir? Oh. You did say she was banging against walls. Chauffeur? Stop by the nearest drive-by pharmacy and order an opioid blocker and enzyme inhibitor.”

## `C2 Draft 1.23` {#c2-draft-1.23}

The wall was concrete and the LED lights warm, the replacements an ugly clashing white. Cheap dark gray square carpet to hide the stains underfoot that they ripped out once every other year. Paris was leaning against the cold wall as I pressed a button on the door and it clicked lock. 

“What?”

“How do I tell you’re dissociating?” 

I flipped up my aviators. “You don’t. Or, maybe you can. Whenever I ask for pills. Oh, yeah\!” I shove him my messenger bag. “Make yourself useful.”

“Did dad get that from you, or you from my dad?”

I led the way down the hall. Took a left. “I think I got it from my dad. He handed me a twenty and his ID and said that, ‘make yourself useful.’ It meant he wanted me to get him beer at the store.” We took another left, then immediately right and up concrete stairs that were close to being dark, half the bulbs flickering you followed a strip of light up the ground. I think they modeled the place after a movie theater. 

“Dingy,” Paris said.

“I guess I can tell you. This is called Sunken Compartments, locally.” 

“Fitting. Yeah, it’s definitely not an apartment.”

“I own the place.” We reached the top. A man in khaki uniform sat behind a desk, flipping through filmy National Geographic. “He’s armed. I keep him hired.”

Brown eyes peek over the top of the magazine. Took his legs off the desk, folding the magazine. “Ma’am.”

“You said I wondered how you got in? You’re on a list, Paris. You told him my real name… To you, that’s just my name I guess. Isn’t that right, Gerald?”

“Yeah… Is there a problem?” 

“No. I need a beer, Gerald.” 

And the man reached under the counter grabbing a duffel bag, zipping it open and shuffling through. A brown paper bag came out, the bag back under him fluidly. It was in my hand and dropped into a pocket. 

“Good night,” I said. A buzzer sounded. We were out the twin metal doors.

Outside, humidity hit like a truck. I never got used to it. I looked up into a window of twilight. It was noon here in Anchorage, and winter, so the day was a two hour opening like some faint hope in this season of darkness. The old moon of rock hung low next to Denali, and the artificial new up high above us shining a bright light that kept the sky in something like a perpetual blue hour. The entire sky lit like a fog hung over us though you could see scant few stars, the light of the two moons coming through the canopy of naked maples like it was thick enough to catch.

“You okay?”

“When we moved here, I fell in love at first sight, at exactly this. And everyday, I fall in love with it again.” 

“Romantic. I don’t remember California much anymore, this is really all I know. What does beer mean?”

I began to walk. I took out the paper bag revealing black steel to him, putting it quickly back  but in the back of my yoga pants this time, tossing the bag to the side. 

“Mind you, Paris. I don’t own the apartments. Not in my name at least. And the guard is security on paper. Nobody knows he’s armed to the teeth, or that he holds onto my guns for me.” 

“Not even Dad?”

“What would you say if I were a cop?”

“Nothing.”

“Ow\! Why’d you pinch me?”

“Because you plead the fifth. Nobody can say shit once you plead the fifth. What do you say?”

“I plead the fifth.”

“It’s the only good thing the fourth branch kept in the constitution.”

“Does Dad know.”

“Probably… But not because I told him.”

“Auntie, are you being oddly open with me?” 

He’s used to his father speaking in riddles and misdirections. I’m not sure Vale knows how to be entirely honest with anybody, hiding at least some information.

“Oh. I spaced out, didn't I?” 

“A bit.” 

We were staring at a Porsche darker than black. It was mine. That was a ten minute walk up three flights of stairs. I don’t remember it, as if teleporting I was here and even that Paris was with me seemed the odd thing now.

“I tried talking to you.”

‘Nothing,” she said. Maybe she was incapable of infliction, now.

And he never answers. She didn’t look to see his expression, didn’t care for closure, but slung out her key fob and pressed it against the door climbing down into the seat of her condom thin low profile wheel, midnight-like sports car. Two midnight doors slammed into their place on the frame.

“Who got who’s taste in cars?”

“A mix. This was the middle ground between a mid-engine Lotus and a heavily modified Skyline.”

“Why’d you leave each other.”

She didn’t feel much at that and almost told him, so little did she feel. Thought better as her lips opened. Had to look at him, but the lights didn’t reach the face of the story. Maybe she didn’t need to look. She looked ahead. Everything thought was subconscious to her, her head blank yet something within her mind racing. She watch the faint twilight out of the gar

“Sorry,” the wise if young man said. 

She pounded the wheel hard. “Don’t apologize if you don’t mean it.” Sniffling. He opened the glove box and a nose of snot blew into some McDonald's napkins. She leaned against the closed car door. He was cradling his head in his hands now in the streetlights glow letting tears stream. She lightly gripped her hand around his wrist, just below where a watch would be. 

“I’m sorry.” 

“You say I’m his mini-me, huh? What’s that make you?” Then his arm twists, pulling up and away. His ugly scrunched up face pivots on the right elbow and the face is hidden again. 

“I’m gonna be very honest. I could not be.”

“What does that mean? *Who are you.”*

Ouch. You sort of feel that one. “We loved each other,” you say.

“Okay—no. You had to leave him. Mom is crazy, was, and always will be. She’s crazy and gets jealous til’ insanity. Dad told me that much… What about me? Why’d you leave me.”

“I still love you.” 

“If you call this love, keep it.”

You feel that one, truly. He knows how to hit. “You’re mini-me, yeah. Was, is, always will be. I’m his other half then. As you can see, that never ended either. Never will, unfortunately. There was a grave mistake that led to your beautiful little sister. Want to hear how everything got fucked.” 

He nods vigorously, though he won’t look at you.

“We hurt as much as we loved. But we always came back, no matter how many times we left, it was always just a break. After enough of that, it was… an open break. Permanently.”

“No shit?” He pivots to you. His eyes are red but the waterworks are done. “I don’t believe it.”

“Do as I say, not as I do. Your fathers unofficial, unspoken motto.”

Because he wouldn’t speak about it unless at gunpoint, not to him. 

“Huh.” That’s all. Wise enough for a single word, you think. He can’t feign but Vale taught him well enough how to obfuscate — monkey see monkey do.

“You a playboy?” You try not to sound like a robot but it doesn’t work and instead you sound demeaning. “Uh. I mean. Are you well versed with girls.”

“Mm… boys, mostly…”

“Good for you. Being gay is way more fun.”

He laughs. A bit is a scoff. “Says the transgender. All sex is gay for you.”

“Took me way too long to realize I was—and when I did it was all fun. The only mistake made between me and your Dad, the only lasting one… Was when he started to spend ‘breaks’ with your mom. Just as friends at first. Told him not to, told him it would lead to sex. That she would still be crazy. Miraculously, not only did the condom ‘not work.’ The birth control ‘didn’t work’ either.”

“I hate Dad, do you know that?” You feel heat, suddenly. “We can’t stand each other. Not since you left.” And something inside you starts to melt around your nose and eyes. You put your head down to that like a blow to your solar plexus. “I resent my sister. I don’t care, not about her or Dad. But Mom? Never could… not, love her. And I hate that most.”

“I aught to fucking kill you.” The anger, coming back to my body with the strength only animosity gives. Like a lion's roar incites fear to the unarmed, that’s how my voice raises. “You don’t get to waste everything we gave up for you. And your sister? You know better, I know you do even if your Dad never got that. Why do you think you have the right?”

“I’m a child.”

“Fuck off. You’ve never been. Takes one to know one.”

“I don’t know what to do.”

I breathe. It’s true, he doesn’t. You wouldn’t, not at that age—no question. This is a blow, too.

“Please let go of my wrist.”

It’s gonna bruise, you know before you can even release your unknown grip. It unsettles you that you don’t feel anything at that pain, your affliction. But you did mean it, you could kill him that second, and it upsets you that the red mark just below where a watch would be feels adequate to your shout as if the mark of a curse you casted.

“It’s not my job to keep my family together.”

You breathe again. Thinly veiled, that. You look out the windshield. It’s dead night again, the equally thin window of twilight gone. The moons are brighter, their light now thick as molasses as if you could bottle the stuff. “Somebody has to…” You hear yourself say. Another breath. He’s winning. “Your Dad could barely keep a relationship with you, even with me in the picture.” He’s a bad father, it’s true. “Least you could do is love your sister…” You're meek. He loves his mother of them all, he said. Didn’t you, too? You let the family collapse. You’re a hypocrite. No. Well, yes. You are. But that’s not what angered you so. 

It’s that… It’s so cyclical it could make you nauseous. You see yourself in your racing seat, back against the car door—alone. As alone as you’ve been since Vale left the framing of your life, what was your child then too. These are the same mistakes you hate in yourself mirrored in this youth, who has always been full of wisdom—just like you. Maybe that’s why it doesn’t feel especially special to see him, he’s never left your heart.


\[X\]You do say humans are mirrors — that’s one of your cardinal rules. It’s true.

“Auntie,” the words bring me out. I don’t recognize the voice. “It’s been ten years. No call, not even a letter,” and my hands are pulling my hair. “In the same way I can’t say I know you anymore, then you can’t know me. Doesn’t matter how much information you have, no matter how many grape vines you heard from.” 

“I need quiet time. I’m overstimulated.”

“You took 120 milligrams of amphetamine.”

“Sush. I know I did, I took it. Hand me the bottles that say modafinil, clonazepam, pregabalin.” 

“How much?”

“One bottle each…”

“No I meant… Fuck. Put us in gear already and tell me the milligrams you need. I can read a goddamn label.”

“Paris.” The engine rumbles to life. “You’re already my favorite secretary I’ve ever had.” 

“I know, Auntie. I know.” 

## `Outtakes` {#outtakes}

You lock the door behind you with Paris leaning on the wall beside. Pat yourself down. A gun, concealed, and your overnight messenger bag. Good enough. White canlight’s with white LED’s light the vaulted hall. You pass by intervals of them then turn left twice into and up darker stairs following yellow LED strips on either side some twenty feet up. The entrance is so well lit it feels like coming out of the maw of some giant and into the sun. 

But you emerge into only a lobby which is overly lit. Behind a desk is security for the apartments belowground, flipping through National Geographic. You wave. He nods ever so slight and there’s an equally light buzz at the twin metal doors leading outside.
