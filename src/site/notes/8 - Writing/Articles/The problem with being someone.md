Around January 2024 I began a strange and horrible process of “ego fragmentation” which sounds more like a supernatural plot device than it does a horrific dissociation fueled psychological assault on your very humanity. 

Who are “you” is what I would come to be intimately familiar with. Far more familiar and feeling with than anyone would ever like. In psychology, having a big ego is a good thing though they wouldn't use the word “big,” they'd probably say developed. The larger your ego is in psychology is saying how developed of a human you are. You can think of it as being a teenager and still not knowing what kind of person you are, what you want to do, even having a concept of what you *might like* as a hobby. As a teen your ego isn't very developed. A doctor with a wife and kids and hobbies who runs a charity has a very big ego, then. 


Fragmentation is a bigger word to say shatter. My ego broke into pieces. There's a recap. My personality, who I am, looked something like what a mirror would if you threw a hammer square at it. I’ll try and use “personality shatter” from here, it’s a lot less pretentious sounding.

Some strange things happen and they happen for a reason. Your mind is trying to separate information that has become so heavy that you begin to dissociate. I’m going to assume you have some idea what this feels like. You cannot imagine the sort of thing I felt unless you’ve been through something life and death.

Dissociation is the process of putting who you are into different pockets to protect you. Any dissociation has this goal. When your personality shatters it’s the large scale version of this — but more permanent. Your mind says, I don’t trust you. And maybe it has good reason to. You’ve been dissociating so much, so severely, that to protect you that permanent measure is taken as some sort of process determines it necessary. Fundamentally, ego fragmentation is a process invoked by dissociation. A lot of it.

Like throwing a hammer at a mirror. In reality, it was more like adding pebbles one by one on a mirror til it breaks—but all the same, it is broken. Who you are is who you were. And — you no longer know what it was like before when you were whole. I got amnesia for large portions of my life. I would forget whole parts of my day. I’d look down. Three hours had passed and I had no concept of anything that happened during this time.

Te concept of belonging has become hugely important to me after my experience of having my personality shatter. I think if there is one thing you can do to help yourself in life, no matter your age, is to fill out a Ikigai circle. Once you have it all filled out and you’re starting to accomplish the goals you made your life feels fulfilling. That’s what belonging is—it’s the feeling you are where you’re suppose to be. 


At 27 years old I had a pretty developed ego in the psychological sense—I even had a bit of an ego in the common meaning. Knowing your place in the universe, knowing what you think the purpose of life is, all the big questions man has asked since they could conceive of asking these questions is a part of finding your belonging. Who you are as a human. I was filling out pretty nice. I’d been on hormones for only four or so months and things were coming to me naturally, I knew more and more everyday what I *really wanted* now.

Let’s say, without judgement that is, that teens with no clue if they even like boys or girls or both yet are not someone yet. They are so undeveloped as a human that their blank slates, their wet clay waiting to be molded. I was… kind of someone before hormones. A bit. It would all turn out to be wrong, so maybe I wasn’t anything… But hey! Hormones will change a lot of things about you. Becoming the opposite sex in physicality will change how you operate, to say the least. 

There was this very strange thing that happened after my personality shattered to it’s height: I completely lost my sense of self, first of all. So if what I thought I knew about myself was wrong in the end after the shatter I didn’t even know who I ever was. There is a theory I have that every time I lose sight of my “self,” who I am… that that person is lost forever and can never be gained back. Lost. For good. This scares the shit out of me and to this day I’m 90% certain this is true and that it’s happened twice now. 

Now, this is what the article is actually about. A teen is not someone yet, but they are a lump of clay. There is something to them. Now let’s say in the lump of clay is a vessel. It’s filled with liquid, the liquid is used like fuel and it refills naturally. I had no clay around my vessel when I lost my sense of self, then. The vessel was exposed, and the vessel then crumbles and lets out all the liquid. It crumbles and crumbles but you can’t put it back together because just like how waves to rock to sand, it’s crumbles til it’s nothing but dust. And I am nothing. There is nothing to me. Teens are a blank slate but I am not even that, I don’t know if I’m even human, I don’t know where I am, I don’t know who I was or if I was ever human whatsoever. I’m dissociating so severely that reality itself is fragile, everything looks and feels like my brain is just making it up as it goes along and if only I could see over my vision there would be a endless white void.

How do you build back from that?

And one part of it is sincerity. Maybe all of it, actually.
