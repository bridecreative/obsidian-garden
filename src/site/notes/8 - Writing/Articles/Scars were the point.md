- Self harm scars were proof I had ever been in such pain. 
- It worked if only for myself. I am a great proponent that you can’t read the mind of others and to not even attempt to unless if your putting together a comprehensive theory of mind using psychology backed methods. 


I’m not a normal person, normal people don’t understand me and so all the people I’ve ever gotten along with even superficially are themselves not normal. This is important because many of the people I connect with most are younger than me. I was born in 1997, I was called a damn millennial growing up then one day I was a “Zoomer” and I was weird for never having used TikTok, all without my consent. So I’m old enough to have to consider if a friend even has the lived experience to understand certain concepts. I just turned 28 but if you told me at 23 about something like, how to responsibly do recreational drugs? Even if I understood I would not have actually listened. I wanted to see what it was like to be on four different drugs at once for the sake of it, responsibility be damned. I don’t remember what that was like but maybe that was the point? 

One thing I try to stress to people is that you can’t mind read. You think they meant this when they did this action? Well I think they did it for no reason, I think they don’t even have a reason. And I’m as right as you because neither of us are them. There is a reason motive isn’t a necessary condition to convict someone of a crime. 

You can never know the truth of what exists only in someone’s mind, you can’t even be sure if they try to convey it to you. Language is fundamentally meant to try to convey ideas, but not everything is a thing you can describe. That’s why you can’t properly explain to a virgin what sex is like or what two tabs of LSD feels like to someone who’s only drank beer.  

I’ve never had someone younger than me be able to grapple with this and win. Hell, I still do it sometimes. There is one way around this, though it’s got it’s own faults and it still doesn’t solve mind reading.

In psychology we have a concept called “theory of mind.” It takes information though, sometimes a lot of it. If you understand someone’s beliefs, their wants, their needs, all those things humans have… we can start to predict their actions. You’ve done this even if you don’t think you have. Like, you understand how your parents operate perfectly. You even know which parent you need to go to get the best results. You have a complex theory of mind of them that goes so deep that you don’t even understand it as that.

To build a proper theory of mind you need to know someone deeply. You can probably build a theory of mind for a politician. Your therapist can build a complex theory of mind of you pretty quickly if their any good.

It’s not everyday that you can build theory of mind by looking at someone—but you might be able to sometimes. 

I’m one of those people. 

I remember, I was in 10th grade and there was this girl in class that I had a crush on bad. I remember, I’d find any excuse to be able to turn to the left and look at the color of her hair. I liked it. 

One time, when I wasn’t admiring her hair, I saw a scar on her wrist hidden under a few bracelets. It broke my heart. I felt some sort of duty at that moment to figure her out and by the next week I’d talked to her enough in the back of the class to convince her to go on a date with me.

She had one scar that she tried to hide. I remember that visceral feeling when I saw it…

I’m covered in them. All over my arms, my abdomen, all of them in patterns. I’m not even sure if you can tell they have a pattern, I’m the one that tried to make them four line parallel with one diagonally across. I tried to make them tally’s, yeah, I have no idea if that comes across. I’ve never asked someone else and I don’t plan to. And my abdomen looks like a doodle art page in a kids notebook. 

I do know—I had that reaction to a single line on a wrist. I think that’s a normal reaction, I’m not atypical for feeling that, am I? But if that’s true… what the fuck do people feel when they see me in a sleeveless shirt.
