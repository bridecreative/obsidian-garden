[[3 - Tags/Article\|Article]]

I’ve played a lot of games… but I’ve also written a lot of stuff. Articles, think pieces, advice, and so much bad fiction it’d make your head spin. I’ve written three novels and started so many others (some of which are actually good) it’d take days to try to count the total. 

Where I used to spend time playing games I write instead. I grew up, in a word. Or that’s what my mom would call it. I say I grew out of the medium and grew into my own calling… because playing games isn’t what you were made to do on Earth. The calling of mankind has always been to create, whether a house that stands a hundred years or painting something made for only your eyes… or the simple beauty of raising a child. We are all here to nurture something great, that’s who people speak of well after our bodies return to dust and that’s something universally understood even if you yourself don’t shoot that high.

Witcher 3 is like that. The Witcher is a series of books that are immortally great. 

And all that has to do with one thing. The quality of writing. If we’re talking about Witcher 3 or the Witcher books or even Witcher 1 & 2 we are talking about the quality of the writing first and foremost, even if you don’t know that’s what you’re talking about. Because let’s be completely honest with ourselves a moment… The quality of writing in games has never been something to write home about and is only going down over time.

Did you hear about Starfield? The writing in that game was so atrocious that it was baffling. How could this even get through quality assurance? What bug tester wouldn’t mention that the writing must be a glitch, it's so bad? And somehow the worst writing in the game is agreed to be the main quest. The thing everyone will play is actually the worst. 

I mention Starfield because it had competition, though most people probably don’t think of it this way. Cyberpunk 2077 was a Bethesda game and it will be better than any Bethesda game ever made again. Playing Starfield and going to Cyberpunk is like whiplash. It could break your neck. Now, I promised myself I wouldn’t buy the game because of the immoral and illegally bad state of its release… so I didn’t. I torrented it. Don’t give them your money, it’s free on the right websites. Give them money when they deserve it.

They deserve your money for Witcher 3… Buy that. You won’t regret it. Did you know they just released a free patch that upgrades the graphics, including adding raytracing? This is, like, a 10 year old game and they went back to give you raytracing. For free. I think they just love the game that much, someone just went and did it for fun.

I don’t blame them. There is so much love in this game, it’s drenched in it. You can feel it in every meticulously placed stone and even if they did use speedtree someone obviously went over it all and made sure it looked perfect… and it does.

And nowhere is that more obvious than the writing. The people who made this went over every bit of Witcher writing in existence, they tore it down to it’s individual atoms and put it all together in the shape of this game. Having read it all it’s so impressive that besides a few times I can recall everything our main character says feels like something the same book character would actually say… word for word, verbatim. You could sincerely be confused that the author himself didn’t write it, it’s that good. It reminds me of fake Chinese made Louis Vuitton: it’s just as good as the original now, even experts can no longer tell the difference without near-scientific testing. 

In other words… it’s a fake of the original but it’s somehow more authentic than its source. The fake is more real than the real thing. It’s come full circle… But all things are cyclical. Sort of what life is about, next to the need to create and nurture. 

The writing is actually what people like I think. The writing is of course what characters are made of and I’d wager my own life that whether they know it or not the characters of the game is what most people fell in love with. Yes, the world is meticulous and beautiful even 10 years later. Everything about the game is filled to brimming over with love. But this is true of so many games… No game I can think of has the love of wording that Witcher 3 has, however. Well, one other. That’s in part 2. And maybe that’s because it’s based off of actual literature, real authentic fiction lovingly continued.

Punch line of the story is this: all the raytracing in the world won’t help if the base elements aren’t convincing. AKA hire good writers and pay them well.
