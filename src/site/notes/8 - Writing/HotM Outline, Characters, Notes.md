SUMMARY


```table-of-contents
```


*‚Äú...and that is based on the premise that knowledge is to be found at the edge of experience and that the body is the site for gaining knowledge.‚Äù*  
	 [Transgressive Fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgressive_fiction) from Rene Chun, a journalist


# Outline
## Values
From [[8 - Writing/New Alaska Mythos\|New Alaska Mythos]]

1\. Intuition
    1\. Instead of logic, they value being able to sense the direction of things. Gut instinct. 

2\. Imagination 
    1\. Basically being a visionary.  
    2\. Being able to come up with novel solutions out of whole cloth.

3\. Belonging
    1\. Your place in the universe.  
    2\. What you want to do with your life. No wrong answer, E.G. I want to be a vagabond.

4\. Mysticism/Spirituality
    1\. Value spirituality over material possession.   
    2\. With enough mysticism, miracles can happen. Miracles come in flavors of the gods.  
    3\. Belief in legends / folklore. 
    4\. \*\*They believe in something like a Ragnarok, and believe one has happened already\*\* (which made the ‚Äòmiracles‚Äô that happen today possible).  
    5\. \*\*Believing in the Gods and Praying to God is a core value in society. If you don‚Äôt you‚Äôre believed to be missing something core.\*\* 

5\. Transcendence 
    1\. With enough spirit you can gain god-like powers. (What powers??)
    2\. Trying to gain something intangible made material, like a gift. Knowledge you shouldn‚Äôt know counts, too.  Or, you could meditate and wake to a silver prosthetic hand in your lap. This hand would operate, essentially, on magic. A miracle. 


## Plot Overview
### Lil Mermaid Idea

>The little mermaid is about giving something up for love. It is about something inhuman becoming human. It ends in tragedy though there was only good will from its actor. 
>
>~~Vivien has five sisters, six sister total of the ‚Äòking,‚Äô who is actually an immortal queen. You meet all of them, and through them you gather what sort of relationship you had with her and what kind of person she is in a Rashomon effect(?)~~
>
>This is about a human becoming God-like. You have to give up a lot to do that. It‚Äôs about humans and nonhumans, including a morally dubious witch. 
>
>They are not sure what they will have to give up that will be ‚Äúproof‚Äù enough of divinity. 
>



### Hamlet Idea





![five-act-play.webp](/img/user/Z-Images/five-act-play.webp)

[[2 - Sources/Hamlet (Video) Notes\|Hamlet (Video) Notes]]

THIS IS WHERE IN [[8 - Writing/Jammey Inflames - Idea, Notes, Outline\|Jammey Inflames - Idea, Notes, Outline]] THE TERRORIST BLOW SHIT UP AND END WITH THE TRAGIC DEATH OF PARIS.


>Somehow, your friend dies for you and their ghost becomes part of you, haunting you.

>You tell the story in the past tense as a part of an overarching narrative to a room of people involved.

>‚ÄùHe‚Äù (who is a stand in for who you were) died for her (sins), the person he was madly in love with. He follows her as a ghost, and she, the woman he loved, tells the story before her inevitable death.

>Due to her taking on the ghost of the lover-friend, she has no idea who she is. She is mantling. Becoming a God. Able to destroy other Gods.

>The ghost will break the fourth wall.

GOAL: Find out who killed your favorite sibling. 

**START:** 
Amnesia, catching Paris up on what‚Äôs happening‚Ä¶ or what you know for sure is happening.
>You are ‚Äúin the war room‚Äù with a projector, sitting on top of a table, drinking a bottle of berserkers moonshine. 
>	You explain to Paris that two nukes have gone off, pointing them out on the projector, her friend is a ghost, and she seems to be mantling. Which means that someone gave their life for her, someone extremely close to her.
>		It is only a matter of time before a God manifests from the disturbance the nukes have done.
>			She can kill this God.
>		In the meantime, she wants to figure out who died to give her this gift.


**RISING:**
Paris helps by making some calls. Namely, to his world renown investigator father, Vale.



MIDDLE: Killing a God

FUCK-UP: Paris dies

END: Adding to the narrative of the world.



The only prop is as many projectors as is needed for the stage. In one of the stages, there is literally a projector in the room.


### Part 1: Equal and Opposite
**OPENING ROLL [[6 - Main Notes/World Building LORE from OneNote\|World Building LORE from OneNote]]**
	The first Gods as they existed were the size of whole galaxies. ~~It is unlikely they had any "will," not as we know it.~~ They were whole, and they were infallible, and of such power it was beyond comprehension but they were not perfect like the Mother that birthed them. The God's were jealous so they broke themselves into many parts in an attempt to make one just as perfect as her image. 
		The remnants, the failures, still plague the stars to this day.  
			‚Ä¶



## New Idea

1. Healthcare, finance, energy. 
2. Energy company and taking it‚Äôs power vacuum
	1. fighting as terrorist
3. ~~Wealth, crypto, finance in general.~~
4. A clash of ideologies 
	1. Authoritarian
	2. Nationalism
	3. localized communities
5. Tech

		1. Neo-luddite 
		2. Also somewhat hypocritical 
		3. Shows how hard it is to actually unplug today

2. idea someone inside the company
	1. they are a true believe, committed to their work
	2. they find something out that makes this idea shatter
		1. moral dilemma 
	3. they just so happen to meet - they know each other from a long time ago, then he must face that this person he loves is actually trying to dismantle everything they thought they knew.
		1. the main character is a high status person, it‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs a nobody and he isn‚Äôt either.

3. a journalist that crosses paths - Paris?
	1. they are already looking for her so that‚Äôs how they cross paths
	2. they have a personal reason to drive them to risk their life to gather info
	3. make her look like a hero not just an anti-hero
	4. risk taker - has a personal interest to do anything at any cost for their story
	5. they become fast friends
		1. they‚Äôll stand up for what they believe in but they have morals they won‚Äôt cross.
			1. is the good guy, though. makes it more light hearted.
			2. comes to a moral dilemma
				1. ‚Äúyou‚Äôll have to shoot at people‚Äù but this crosses the line. 
	6. they were a detective. they already know how to work undercover.

## Outline















   













## Chapter 1 Outline

### DRAFT 1.00
1a - 1c: Introduction is ‚Äòeveryday,‚Äô then ‚Äòone day‚Äô combined.  
Approximately 4,000 words total. No more than 7,000.

1A. Everyday‚Ä¶ You see the character wake up. They slept like a baby. There is a man half asleep, half naked, on a cat-clawed recliner in the corner. He says, ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt know how you managed to sleep tonight.‚Äô ‚Äî because today is the big day. Essentially the start or end of your life, depending on how things go. ‚ÄòI can sleep under any condition ‚Äî it‚Äôs one of my finer qualities.‚Äô And she smiles. She is at peace with today. ‚ÄòJust can‚Äôt wait to be shot at,‚Äô apparently. And she means it. She‚Äôll feel better once she‚Äôs holding a rifle. She gets up, wraps a blanket around her and shuffles over onto his lap. Now the cat‚Äôs not the one purring, but her.


### DRAFT 1.70/PLOT
### a1
**RULE 1: LOVE YOUR MAIN CHARACTER TO DEATH AND BACK**
<font color="#953734">a1-a2</font>

**<font color="#953734">a1:</font> watch the end of the world**

1. this is simple. it‚Äôs just a pretty story of the world ending with your lover. Two nukes go off. It is shown it‚Äôs basically the world of Dredd, except everyone with a gun is their own Judge and the actual Judges are the worse villain's of them all, corrupt to the core.


**Your mother dies. You become holy, where there was green there is golden light in your eyes. You are mantling into Godhood. In this same instance, some supernatural effect shakes the earth and a God is manifested:**

From [[6 - Main Notes/World Building LORE from OneNote\|World Building LORE from OneNote]]
>the universe, now in existence yet empty, created a Mother to birth itself---so that it may experience all that it has. The Mother, often called All-Mother, started backwards---she created many ways that life may itself give life in a begotten never ending cycle. In making everything there is, the Mother had to make ways that it may return to nothing where it came. ~~It is not known why it must return to nothing---but it must,~~ so she birthed the first Gods.  
>
>The God's were jealous so they broke themselves into many parts in an attempt to make one just as perfect as her image. The remnants, the failures, still plague the stars to this day.  
>


- Your mother is the monster. You must kill her‚Äîno one else can.
- There are two of your mother now. The imperfect God and the Fallen Angel (failed god manifest) who grows more and more by the minute.
	- The Fallen Angel is sort of like Pan.
	- You can calm her with your music, which was once hers.
	- Kind of accidentally taken from FFX(?)


She takes the soul of Brand at the end of the Chapter. He dies in body and lives on spiritually as a medium she can use to move around with in The Web (name???)

Another person gives their life for her in the next chapter.


### b3-b4

**<font color="#7030a0">Outline:</font>**
**b3**
1. Brand is now a spirit that can be controlled when she‚Äôs got her eyes closed (at least for now)
	1. Brand is going to corrupt her and kill her. His essence is volatile, he is now going to turn her ruthless and violent with time and her body will ‚Äúfragment‚Äù and her memory turn into something like dementia. 
	2. ‚ÄúTHERE IS SOME CONTOUR OF A POLYHEDRAN BOTH CORDED AND SOLID BLINDING AND DEFENING THAT SEEPS INTO HER, EACH POINT OF CONTACT ITS OWN RIVER TO WHIRLPOOL LEADING INTO A STAGNANT WATER.‚Äù
2. (who is likely to have information on this?)
	1. Freaking out, what would be in character for her to do:
		1. Drink.
		2. Look at herself in the mirror. Dissociation: she can‚Äôt tell it‚Äôs her face.
		3. **She prays. Show her praying before this, that it‚Äôs a normal thing to do.**
			1. ‚ÄúTELL ME WHAT TO DO, GODDESS‚Äù and there is an answer. ‚ÄúFIND X-family-member.‚Äù 
			2. You have a huge influential family that you disavowed. 
			3. The eldest, that‚Äôs what you call Augury even though he has a twin sister, Piety. 
3. Someone in the family sacrificed or was sacrificed for a terrorist attack.
	1. The ultimate question is‚Ä¶ who, and which? And the eldest has the answer, wherever he is‚Ä¶ seems like he‚Äôs dead or severally wounded (teleported)
	2. elite overproduction. the story ends in you becoming God of Arcadia. 




b4
1. She is possessed by Godhood. She does things despite herself. But she is still herself at this point. Her goal at this time is to figure out how to save her life as she knows it.
	1. There is a plague. It‚Äôs turning people into spirits of pack animals that are‚Ä¶ disturbing. Like in strawberry shortfuse. Monsters seem to manifest out of nowhere.
	2. she is immune to disease. If she does X, they‚Äôll extract him into a machine (ghost in the machine) but she will never be the same.
	3. This is her reason to fight‚Äîinitially, at least.
