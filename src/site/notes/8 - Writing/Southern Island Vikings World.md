## üê±‚ÄçüêâJot-down // Misc

Southern, weird Catholic-like Vikings who worship Mary just as much as God, with Pagan identifiers mixed into it.

Jesus is the son of God. God put Jesus in the womb of Mary, he impregnated her. 
1. How would it be the other way if God was Goddess? 

There is another religion gaining power.

## Culture
Extremely multi-culture, many races coexist

- Honor is, first and foremost, the most important thing. To dirty honor is to be outcast or even exiled.
	- Exile is worse than death. This is why people introduce themselves as ‚Äúof X community‚Äù or ‚ÄúSon of X person.‚Äù
- Assassinations happen but are rare, people would rather agree, a gentleman agreement mind you, to have a shootout in broad daylight. 
	- Dueling with blades will happen for ‚Äúbloodpayment,‚Äù even though it is called bloodpayment everyone always has a right to fight back, should they choose.
- And they do, but **community is the first and foremost important thing.** If something were to endanger the community any feud, no matter how horrible, would be dropped for the greater good.
	- Gift giving society. Money means little, sharing means everything. Golden rings, new weapons and armor, etc.



## Viking Virtues

Virtues are important. They are a bit different though. 

Old ways
1. Courage to face any hardship, including death, and to face your fate, with stoicism. 
2. Honor was first and foremost prized after being brave.
3. Loyalty to first your parents then your cousins, then your direct community, so on.
	1. To break loyalty, man or woman, was to expect bloodshed as payment.
4. Honesty and truth was prized. Lying was disgraceful, so was slander, these were serious offenses and could ruin your life.
5. Resilience was expected whether it was toughing out the cold, going on long voyages, waging war, fighting long battles.
	1. It was highly admired trait. 
6. Self-reliance
7. Hospitality was sacred, guests were to be treated with utmost respect.
8. Justice (vengeance) was expected to be dished out by yourself most of the time. A chieftain may resolve issues such as resolving a dispute, but where unjust bloodshed was concerned you were expected to be taken up personally to restore honor or otherwise lose your honor.
9. Wisdom was prized, though perhaps the least.

Culturally
1. ‚ÄúSpecialization‚Äù OR; **Belonging**
	1. Knowing your place in the community and mastering it.
2. **Adding to the narrative.** Becoming so great that you are never forgotten within your direct community and, hopefully, so great you transcend where you come from.
3. Taking action - especially in the absence of someone else whos job it is neglecting it, and doing it yourself instead


New virtue
1. Intuition 
2. Imagination - This was being able to come up with a plan that nobody expected that saved lives in a novel way. Highly respected trait, sign of a great leader.
3. Luck (Fortune)
4. Spiritualty
5. Transcendence 




## All-Mother

Purpose of religion: where we come from, why we are here, where we end.

We come from the all mother. We are here to experience life, we die to experience life after our due time in Haven for our good where we live in perfect wellness with all we want and our ancestors then we rebirth, at the end of time we are to join the gods in a great fight against the outer-world. If we win, the universe will start all over again.

Weird Catholicism. People have ‚Äúmantled,‚Äù AKA become saints. You pray to the mantled minor Gods who were once humans. Mantling is a destructive process. The minor Gods are said to interfere with the lives of men still, though rarely. Many of them are Gods that are associated with guiding the dead. The Gods are said to be a manifestation of a single, ‚Äúinfinite‚Äù God which is eternally good and true. 
- We are simply a shadow of the perfect versions God has created, imperfect replicas, their casted off shadow onto this world. 

God is Goddess. God is considered a woman, she gave birth to all creation from nothing. Her spirit inhabits the world and creates ‚Äúmagic,‚Äù which they call miracle.

All things have holy in them from the All-Mother. The amount you have is shown in your eyes, golden, like slivers. 



- Death isn‚Äôt a bad thing, and not to be feared but stared in the face and challenged there is an unhonorable way to die and this is said to curse your living family if you die without dignity. 
- There are many places for the dead. You have some amount of choice it is believed, some will try to go to a certain Haven. There is no bad Haven where the wicked go. 



Another ‚Äúcult‚Äù







A philosophical witch. What philosophy pops up? Ethics? Free will? 
1. She goes around and asks the best way to live. 
2. What does it mean to be human. 
3. There are wisps, like little ethereal fairies that cannot be interacted with. What do they mean? 
4. ==How do you know the Goddess exists? She asks everyone this.== 
	1. She's undergoing a crisis of faith?
5. Is there good and evil?
