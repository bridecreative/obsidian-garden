# Part 1 

## `Draft ALPHA`

The hounds were double the mass of a pitbull also with double the amount of legs of any dog and had razors lining their mouth not unlike a sharks where you always expected normal, if large, canine teeth to be. The serrated edges… they always catch people off guard, even a third or fourth encounter. You never really get used to how the lip uncurls to snarl, or how the snarl somehow looks like a smile, and makes too much of the face.

Her dad would say the military was good for one thing—cleaning up the mess they made. He’d say: these beasts were here because the military piled up so many bodies and stirred so much unrest that The World Listened. It had to—unlike humans, The World can’t close its eyes or ears to injustice, to disrespect to the dead, to the brutality of the world. 

That’s why the hounds were here, he’d say.

On the school bus, when she still went to school, she had an odd but vivid memory that always stuck out like a sore thumb in her mind. The bus passed by and looking out the window she saw a man in gray uniform wearing a gasmask burning the dead, this soldier's comrades and her own side, just the same way he burnt the snarling beasts, sweeping the gushing flames of his weapon like he was weeding a garden. 

Everyone knew you burnt the dead with hardwood. A pyre, if at all possible, but to burn them on the spot. It made the girl with strawberry hair think this was an intentional act, like her dad said, as biased as he is and she knew well. She didn’t trust her dad. He said he never lied, and she believed that true, he thought everything he said to her true even if it wasn’t. But when you see at a young age the enemy disrespect even their own dead, indecency to give proper burial, just passing by to school… it makes the calamity that sits over them now seem inevitable, and on purpose.

Like her dad said. 

Now, people listened when he spoke like he was an apostle. Things he said came true, and the more grime the more truth in them.

The girl with strawberry hair didn’t believe her dad because her body said not to, rejected the idea viscerally, though she didn’t know why in a conscious sense. She had no memory till she was almost out of primary school, she didn’t know anything about childhood with him. When she was around him, or he touched her even briefly, she became uncomfortable in her skin. If she kept thinking about it, she felt eyes on her and unwanted attention. 

She tries not to think about it anymore. 

Instead, when he was around now she found that reality became like she was looking into a mirror, one that was just a convincing copy of where she actually was. Then when you were in the mirror world that was like ours, it felt like everything just out of vision was being made by herself as she went along. She made the tree’s and the clouds and that’s why the sky was blue static, she wanted it to be. That her life was what it was, is what it is, that made sense too to her then. 

The priest called this solipsism.

“Speak in English.”

“It means you’re the only thing you can know is real, little one.” He always calls her that. “It’s what you just described. A sense that nothing else but yourself is true.”

“Okay, old one.” She often spoke to the priest, and just like this, always a short tempered strawberry brat. She didn’t hold religion, not agnostic or atheist, just didn’t hold a drop of anything spiritual in her. Christian was just what she was born as. 

“What do I do? Go to the doctor?”

“No… It’s philosophical.”

“It’s creepy. I hate it. Can’t you do an exorcism?” 

And she got him to laugh. She loved nothing more than getting a hardy laugh from the priest. 

“Sometimes we don’t find philosophy, but it finds us. Nothing to get rid of, but to think about. Shares a lot in common with our God, don’t you think?”

Her eyes glaze over though. “You don’t seem real,” she says.

She couldn’t think about this either.

“Does it matter if I am?”

But the words came from somewhere else. There is a lull. Her head slowly tilts to the left like she tends to do.

Her dad was a genius, people said. They called him an artist, too. That was after he learned to make bombs. Before that, he was better known as a maniac, and nuanced people would admit he was just manic depressive but always quite possibly dangerous. They didn’t know the half of it. Then when they needed dangerous maniacs he was suddenly a respected member of the community.

It was sometime in the summer where the strawberry girl would become a strawberry woman, and her dad brought her through a forest and switchback up a ledge deep into someone's private property. He told her when to step over wire, booby traps to warn someone was coming. *Pain in the ass to set up again*, he said. The shack was situated in such a location that if there were visitors you always had the advantage, you couldn’t scale the sides. It was placed in such a way it was invisible from below, situated in a forest. 

It’s where he made bombs. 

But the girls first question wasn’t about combustion when they got inside.

“Why’d you choose me over brother?”

“Because he’s an idiot that can hardly be trusted with a gun. You’re smart Maeve.”

So it was, the young woman dropped out of highschool into a homeschool curriculum involving only chemistry that included using primers. 

## `Part 2A`

“This is fun,” that was her first thought. After the drilling, that is. Don’t ever do this. Or that. Repeatedly. And her father reinforced when she did good but also had a willow switch that would slam into her hands before she could even finish a mistake.

Her wrists and knuckles drew slim lines of blood after three days emulating the chemistry. Her father had a willow switch that whipped into her before she could even finish a mistake. The problem was the bigger the bomb the safer it was to make. Small ones, the kind you could throw, those tend to explode in the face. But most of it was the same. Find a way to make metal explode out so that it makes shrapnel. 

She was given a pistol. That was the turning point, chemistry be damned.

“You point it at the thing you want to kill.” 

He’d already told her all the rules.

But when she felt its weight, each ounce of the metal was power in her hands. She knew every bullet could be a death. She felt it across. Her thumb cocks the hammer back like instinct and brings it up level, looking down the ironsight. *Only point it at someone if you intend to shoot,* her fathers instructions reverberated. Her fingers itched to pull.

“I don’t like those eyes,” the priest said. “Maeve. Maeve\!”

She shivered. Looked around. 

“I’m sorry.”

“This happens when your dads around, you said.” He said it with urgency.

“I’ve been around him a lot.” 

Then the priest leaned in too close. She wanted to step back, though faked nonchalance. The priest whispers, “Is your dad a good man?”

And she shakes her head. She was pointing the gun at her dad, the person who gave her the gun. Was that moments before? And he said nothing. He was blanched, the blood drained from his face and his eyes hollow. 

“I’m sorry\!” She slammed the gun on the table gripping her face. She waited for beratement. For a hard backhand slap. The silence only made it worse until her nails dug into her forehead and her fingers itched to pull her skin off. Seconds passed…

She whispered, “Aren’t you mad?” 

“No…” He trailed off. “I wish I’d killed the man who gave me my first gun. Weapons aren’t gifts, their a strict burden. Maeve?”

“Yes.” 

“You will be killing people. Make no mistake about it.”

A small screen separated the priest and her. It was dark, only a slant of light filtering in from the crack in the door of this little booth highlighting the motes of dust.

“Well?” 

“None of that is sin,” replied the priest. “There’s nothing to forgive.”

“Feels like a sin to me. I’ll kill you next time, that’s what he said after that.” 

“Maybe you should have killed him.” 

“Would you forgive that?”

“I’m not sure men like him need forgiveness to kill.”

It sounded most like the door got kicked open. The priest wasn’t there when she looked. Maeve sat there, her expression blank. That’d be the last of her sitting.

“Do I get one of those?”

It was sleek black and about half the length of an arm. Notches in the muzzle that she could already imagine flashes of light shooting out of them in intervals aimed at the enemy. He attached a stock to it, like magic to her it slid on and made a satisfying click. Holding it to his shoulder, the gun pointed up at the ceiling. 

His hair was fair, though skin kissed from the sun he didn’t have a freckle. Maeve liked his presence. “This toy is for boys only,” the man said. It was somewhere between bravado and independence. She thought well of independence and always fell for the other despite herself. 

She likes her men to have one or the other and he had both.

Maeve still had strawberry hair but she grew an inch and more than that in her bust. Puberty was late, but it blessed her with beauty. Men liked her just like she liked men… and she loved men. She thought of them as something like alcohol, some is fun but too much kills. She wanted all of this before her, gripping black steel, even if it did kill her. He wore shades, but she could feel his eyes on her body and it was right, the good kind of attention. 

Thinking of touching his skin was an antidote and she dying from poison. 

All she managed was, “What's your name?” 

“I should be saying that to you. Call me Kyler.”

“You didn’t ask because you already knew,” she chanted out. “I know because everyone knows of you too.” 

“We finally meet.”

And she giggled. She was high already. 

“Don’t let a man hit you, Maeve.” 

“You're a man.”

“I don’t hit women. I slapped you as a girl. See the difference? Don’t let anyone piss on your leg and tell you it’s raining. You kill them there or get killed. Understand? That’s why I gave you a gun.”

“You gave me a gun when I was thirteen, a girl.”

“You make bombs. You make the weapons we use to kill. Do you ever wonder how many people you helped kill in only the first year? No. Don’t flinch, Maeve. Respect yourself. Guard your dignity. You’ve been complicit in the death of hundreds already. One more is nothing. No god will protect what’s yours to defend, nor should they.”

“You’re beginning to sound like the priest, Dad.” 

“What’d he say to that?” The priest was wobbling ever so slightly. He reeked of scotch, whiskey, and beer. His hair was greasy. He’d been like this about as long as Maeve had been through her growing phase, though he never stopped this drinking. 

“I need to sober you up.”

“How?”

“Coffee?” 

“I need sleep.”

“If you're not asleep, you're drinking. Staring at walls. You’re killing yourself, you know that? It’s the same as hanging, just slower.”

“Sometimes I feel like the dissociation left you and haunted me.”

“What’d you say to that?”

She liked the smell of his bare chest in bed after he showered. It was sort of like diesel—musky, too much was overwhelming but a little smelt good, and his was intoxicating even though she was the one named after the goddess of intoxication. She didn’t want to answer, just lay there in bed in his security with his unique scent.

“Maeve?” 

“Huh?”

“Name five colors you see.” 

“No. I want to float away.”

“You never told him. Why.”

“He’s old. He’s helped me for long enough with my dissociation.”

“You never get enough help. There’s no such thing.” 

She was chewing her nails.
