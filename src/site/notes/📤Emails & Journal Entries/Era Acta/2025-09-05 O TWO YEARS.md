NEW ME ANNIVERSARY. I’ve been on hormones for two years! Wow. 

What insightful shit do I have to tell you (me)?
	Nothing.

I think I struggle with alcoholism. Then I don’t. Then it takes awhile, but I look back to now and *know with my heart* I indeed do. I bought a six pack of 16oz Coors and drank them all before my mom even got home at 8. Can’t even make this up. It didn’t phase me. At all. I don’t even know what to say. But this is a retrospect thing. This is me trying to comprehend the event, it just took me til right now as I write this to even acknowledge the severity of it. That always gets me, when I don’t realize how much I drank until well later not as I’m drinking too much like a normal person would.

I flirted with Cady. That was fun. I’d actually date him. I would.

I didn’t see my mom when she came home I don’t think. I don’t recall actually.

it’s 12AM.
