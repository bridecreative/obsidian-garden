Hi! My name is August. Life is Cyclical. I live in the south, but like the south-east not deep in it. I'm a lil’ Christian. I'm a transwoman. I'm complicated and toxic to be around too long, somewhat like nuclear waste—and just like nuclear waste, you should keep a geiger counter on you while being here. 

Some things I like is writing. I try to read, I say I like reading, but really I got a stack of books that make me look smart even though I'm more stupid than the next person. 

Fun facts about me: I have a lot of scars and I can barely feel anything. I have even more trauma than I do scars somehow and it's a miracle I'm functioning whatsoever.
