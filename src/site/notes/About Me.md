Hi! I’m a transgirl in the south. But the south-east, not deep in it. I’m a lil’ bit Christian. Just like that, I’m mostly a walking-talking contradiction. I write, I wish I read more than I do, I love as fiercely as I’ll argue til I’m blue in the face for what I believe in.

Welcome to what I’ve drafted. I’m so sorry you’re here.

Call me James. I’m in my late 20’s.
