#WhoAmI 

***You are more than the sum of your parts** like few things are, as all humans are. Sometimes you're not you, however. Sometimes, we lose our way and our purpose that used to flow like a mighty river stagnantes and your happiness becomes infested.* 

*When we can’t feel the magic in this world we will return here.*

*AMEN.*

1. Stop looking for every thing and let your self see.   
   1. There’s beauty even in the seasons of death.  
   2. Don’t fret, everything is cyclical. It’ll rebirth.

2. Life without discipline isn’t a life worth living.  
   1. Don’t do permanent damage based on temporary emotions.

3. If you aren’t as intense as where you are you’re as good as dead.  
   1. Hedonism is okay sometimes. But so is murder.   
   2. Don’t push away your anger. Watch it burn.

4. Don’t buy what you want, buy what you need.  
   1. Better yet, don’t want for anything. You already have all you need.  
   2. Of all the things you have you need little of for happiness.   
   3. Desire is a shackle, don’t mistake it for motivation.

5. When you bring something out of where it belongs, bring balance to yourself.  
   1. If you don’t know what this means, go to church.

6. Love and respect aren’t separate, they're intertwined.   
   1. Respect yourself. If you don’t know what this means, do a face mask.  
   2. Give only respect that’s deserved, but always do so.

7. Live as if the world is infinite and you must leave it for a future unseen.   
   1. If you don’t know what this means, start recycling. 

8. We aren’t ‘social animals,’ we can’t live without others.   
   1. We are made to serve.  
   2. You owe all you are to others.

9. Embrace the pain. It’s yours and yours alone.  
   1. Do you have hope? If not, fix that first.

10. You already made it.
