`“Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.”`			   
	`-George Santayana`	


Everyone is always saying to live in the present and in the most strange twist of fate it seems that is all I can do. The past isn’t mine to remember, there is some sort of rudimentary system implemented in my head to decide what I can and cannot have memory of and more and more none of it is mine. I can look to the future, things seem fine — not much to dwell on there. And I can be here. But the past is not mine, not even mine insofar that I can use it to avoid making the same mistake twice.

So I’d love to try and tell you what’s happened since November when I last sent you a PDF of how things were but I honestly can’t say, not without looking through texts, photos, external information. I got into an extremely intense (mostly physical) relationship, my first relationship actually… With a 44 year old cis man. He is his own novel, just as unique as me and even now I have a ping in my heart that it was made to be. 

And it seems as though the metamorphosis I started with HRT is coming to a close, now. I’m coming out of the chrysalis and each day I close in from “transitioning” to just transitioned, I feel.

One thing struck me like a backhand when I went back and read what I sent you in November. I was… absolutely enchanted. And I knew the reason why I wasn’t anymore without even thinking. It’s the same reason my OSDD won’t give me my memories, it’s the same reason I can’t enjoy anything, it’s why I’ve become a jaded person, and explains why my emotions can be so stone cold. 

It’s called PTSD and as I slow from a turbulent transition to a new normalcy I find this the most difficult thing I grapple with day to day. It’s shocked into my system so thoroughly that it can override absolutely any other emotion in absolutely any given situation. It is the master of my mind, even my body, and all parts that make up me is a slave to when it whips out a command.

It’s also my greatest strength — in the worst possible way. I’m a bumbling idiot without it, I have no grace or appeal and I’m horrible with people without it’s presence. I actually understand why PTSD is often confused for autism in my own physical feeling, not an intellectual understanding. 

I… can’t give up now. There have been times I have wanted to relent, to slow down, and it’s not possible. It’s not that I pushed through, it’s that I was unable to allow myself to not. You will now struggle to your last breath. You are more machine than human. You’re impervious, you’re perfect, nothing can stop you. And you ooze that to others — I’m not ugly but I’m not beautiful either, but beautiful people seem to come to me now. And your brain during that time is… just one frequency. That frequency doesn’t allow you to consider other people's feelings. So you often trample them. I’ve trampled many good things now, and the oddest thing happens, that when you’re in the midst of an episode and you do a wrong you'd sooner slit your own throat than apologize. I can even admit I was in the wrong to myself. I could say it to the person I wronged as well (I shouldn’t have said that), but consolation for the action? Never. Can’t even force myself, even outside the episode. It’s not even a pride thing, it’s this subconscious principle I can’t even begin to describe. 

Maybe it is a pride thing, actually…

I suspect PTSD is also the reason why I can’t feel anything physically anymore. It takes an incredible amount of force compared to normal for me to register any sensation, and I basically can’t feel “normal” everyday pain for all intents and purposes. It was actually alarming when it first took root, I thought there was something wrong with me.

Sometimes it’s like I’m seeing in color the first time in my life. I’ll look in the mirror and it’s as if I’d never seen my own face, and it ingrains itself into my brain as if I’d just fell in love with someone… but it’s me in the mirror. I didn’t know my hair was that color, or my eyes that pretty, or my chin that shape. And some weeks it’s as if I can’t see at all, I’m just some primal beast that only reacts to stimulus and hasn’t “seen” once in its life.

My whole life has been this, now. 

I cut the other week when I was in between jobs. I was insecure about my housing, it was a moment of weakness. It was the first time I stopped depersonalizing since I got here, though. I said to Madeleine during this brief window,

“I am somewhat aggressive, absolutely an intense person and opinionated even if I’m informed. These are the bad things about me. My good side is that I’m a deeply caring person and when I’m not intense I’m pleasant and good at making people laugh. I’m someone you’d either want as a friend or want nothing to do with and know would make a horrible adversary. Internally, I am completely lost and deeply troubled.”

So something good came from a strictly bad action …Internally I am completely lost and deeply troubled. And that’s stuck with me, deeply. I sincerely hadn’t known that until then.

At this point it occurs to me that while none of what I say rings a bell, you probably have some deja vu going on, huh?

I come out of my cocoon and… life is different, now. And I don’t even have the memory to tell you how it’s different. It’s been less than five months with bipolar and PTSD at the conditions they are, but these two things in tandem have forever changed how I interact with the world. 

Hannah… sort of warned me, in a way. “I have bipolar and PTSD, too. It gets better.” It gets better, but it never resolves. I was covered in fresh scars when she said that, and that reassurance in the face of someone very clearly courting death was like sunshine in a world with only rain. I could cry even now.

And that’s where I am now.

It did get better, Hannha. I couldn’t imagine back then when you told me. And when I look back from this better place now, I don’t know how it could ever have been like it was — if I didn’t have the scars to prove I was there for it. 

The past might not be mine, and it may never be again. But if I’m learning anything as I transfer from someone transitioning to a woman to actualized womanhood, I’ll have to learn to live with a unique combination of handicaps — I’ll have to flip them like judo into the best parts of me. 

So I might be stuck in some loops. Some things may never stop repeating. But if I do it all with love and sincerity, if I make goals because I can see the future, I do see hope… 

I went on my first date the other day. It was horrible, but the fact stands: there are people who find me attractive for who I am. That I’m not something nobody wants to be seen in public with, there are actually people who would hold my hand proudly. I am… more normal than I ever thought possible. I can make roots here, I can help my community, make friends, nothing is out of my reach like I assumed and if anything it’s more close to me than it’s ever been before.

I really have only you to thank for that. Without your support and continued support I might as well have moved to Tennessee so I could pick my casket. 

I’m honestly glad I have difficulties ahead of me, these things will help me grow as a person. I’ll overcome challenges that to anyone else would seem like they belonged in a supernatural genre novel. Who the hell has to account for not knowing who they are? Sounds pretty fictional in terms of problems to me.

I look forward to life, a life I lease from you, and I hope it’s as intense as me. 

Wouldn’t wanna get bored.
