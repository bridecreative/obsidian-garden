If I didn’t know better I’d say outside the borders of Tennessee is an ocean and this place an isolated island. I’d say, people were abducted here through magical portals hundred of years ago from a hundred different worlds and they all mixed in this melting pot that was never taken over by one kind of peoples but all of it weaved into the land itself, the culture the same as when they came because the world itself determines what will be. They're all revolutionary, they're all divided three ways and they like it like that and everyone has the warrior gene that doesn’t hesitate or flinch at blood. Women are as much men as any man here if not stronger. But there's still harmony, and they still unite and they all give it their all for what they believe in which is unsaid but felt viscerally. 

I couldn’t imagine a place like this. I make fantastical worlds, ones filled with fantasy and the supernatural and ones built on top of technology that doesn’t yet exist but I could never, never make a configuration of things to look and feel like this world I was also abducted into. I’m in love with the people, I’m in love with this world configured from the same materials as where I came from but ordered vertically and nonuniform with dozens of influences from dozens of cultures and styles over 200 years of taking in other people also abducted by the beauty here, the intensity that draws you in… weaved into the world here.

The sky always get me, the fact that grass grows lush without watering, the flowers and trees that dip down over the rolling hills where you can almost see where soldiers must have marched over and hid behind and rolled cannons up fighting the union, confederates that thought they had a right to separate from the united states. Tennessee was divided then at once united then as much as they are now, some 150 years later for the freedom of slaves that in many ways are still in love with this town that was once a trading post. The old name of Columbia, where I live? Muletown. You could buy mules here as much as you could buy a human that was as much livestock as the mules sold in this town. They celebrate that history, can you believe that? And blacks come in cowboy hats and their shitkickers. Unexpectedly united.

Community here is so tight knit I don’t have words for it. It’s something out of fiction. It doesn’t exist where I’m from. Here I am, I have everything I wanted and things I could never imagine or wish for.

Yours truly as always,

August
