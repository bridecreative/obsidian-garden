Constitution: 

## `Book 1: Spirit`  {#book-1:-spirit}

**Flame** is sacred. Flame is the ultimate cleanse. The natural state of all things is to become part of the dust it was borne of. We are all huge collections of it—and put under flame, we return to it in the form of ash. Ash is symbolic of that—ash is part of the larger dust, dust will feed the trees. Become part of the ground. To nourish new life, to become food that will be consumed, to nourish and fuel and return again. Dust and ash is the start and end. When you start fire, always consider that you are not too different from the flame that warms you. And that you too will become ash, someday. Surrender to it.

**Blood** is sacred. Blood needs cleansing. Blood is the ultimate payment. Blood belongs in its place. To spill blood is wrong because you brought it out of its rightful belonging. Nothing is right or wrong. But if you spill blood, you are unclean. Light flame and surrender yourself to Above.

Of **good and evil** and right and wrong \- these are fabrications. We Below put attributes to things as good or right and wrong and evil because it is easier than whatever the truth is. Everybody can redeem themselves—it’s just that sometimes to redeem will take longer than you have left to live.

Everything has a **belonging** \- you are not able to change what is not in your Providence. No matter how hard you might try. The only thing you are given absolute agency over is your own self. It would pay you dividends to think about the boundaries of what makes you up. And then to stay within them. That is the control over your belonging. You would be wise to remember that of everything that belongs to you, you need little of it. And of what you need, you don’t need control of often.

**Providence** is fate, and rarely destiny, decreed by those Above. Fate is inevitable. Destiny is when you were given choices, but that you were forced to choose. 

**Boundaries** are sacred. They are your own providence, or as close to divine will as a human can come to. When a boundary is broken, the breaker is unclean and must be kept away for the remainder of the year—or as much as is possible. Hold suspicion for the person who would knowingly break a boundary. Always tell the person that they have broken it, and in plain English.

## `Book 2: Truth` {#book-2:-truth}

1. As a rule of thumb, people only talk about ‘truth’ when there is a ‘person’ involved. Nobody cares about the truth of how a tree in a forest fell. We care when we say, ‘if there is no *person* there to witness it, did it make a noise?’ Observation is important. Only humans can observe. Going by this rule, this section will be how to handle the individual. Think of it as interpersonal politics. 

2. Forgiving someone, truly forgiving them, is a hundred times more difficult a task than holding your anger against them. And that’s how you know that practicing clemency is the greater way of life—anyone can harbor resentment all their life. That’s easy. It takes a brave heart to love someone who slighted you, however.

3. Your perception of yourself won’t change the reality of who you are. You don’t get to dictate your reality—others do. That’s why there's so many of us. 

4. Change the perception of others, that's when you boon from a difference. 

5. I pity nobody more than the person who thinks they understand others. You’ll be lucky if you ever understand yourself, let alone anyone else.

6. The truth is a sphere that spits you out the closer you get to it. What you view looks entirely different to the person looking on the other side. 

7. Even if you submerged yourself to drowning in the truth it means nothing. People only care about the style of truth, not the actual substance of it. People want the truth to be sexy and if it isn’t they’ll find a truth that is.

## `Book 3: Nations` {#book-3:-nations}

## `Book 3: Person` {#book-3:-person}

1. If other people dictate who we are, the only conclusion to come to is that we were made to be around others, and others around us. Nobody is an island, we’re more like the oceans than that.  
2. 

## `Book 5: Practice` {#book-5:-practice}

1. If karma exists—if there is divine balance? Do not leave what must be done to the thought that balance works by itself. Nothing is a weaker force than letting someone’s sleight “work out itself.” You correct the wrong you see—or assume it’ll never be brought to peace. And make your peace with that.  
   1. It’s okay to let go of a clear wrong. Just don’t take any comfort that a Godly notion will fix it for you. You fix what’s important to you—more importantly, what’s in your Providence. That is yours to defend, nobody else can or should step in for you. Not even a God.

2. Pascals Scale:  
   1. If there is spirit and you do not honor it, you can only stand to lose a quality of life otherwise there for everyone else to boon from  
   2. If there is spirit and you surrender to it, you only stand to gain the boon others have from their same surrender  
   3. There is no opting out—one must admit to spirit or not for even inaction is its own action.  
   4. Either way, there is spirit. Just depends how you weigh it.
