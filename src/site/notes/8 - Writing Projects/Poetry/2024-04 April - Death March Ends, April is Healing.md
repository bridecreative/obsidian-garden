[[8 - Writing Projects/Poetry/2024-05 May - a bloody April, hope for May - amen.\|2024-05 May - a bloody April, hope for May - amen.]]


for You, dissociative one  
who brought me at Great Distance   
and keeps Distance around Them  
as if celestial in nature  
bending reality and refracting time  
to bring myself back, Here and Now.   
All consuming numbness  
a out of place hellish reversal, always  
the most powerful force  
Harbinger of Nothing thank you   
I cross River Stix everytime   
you visit  
yet I still live.

I'd rather be in a room with my PTSD demon,   
Than know there was nothing between me  
And that fucking patch of grey sky.   
It seems a more friendly place  
Bottomed out in the Mariana Trench  
Than to see the void I know leads into  
Dead   
Space 

Love that is not yours is mortal coil.   
Love not yours to give or take. Love you loaned,  
she is your shackle–she is endless toil.   
And now you owe ruinous debt in whose name?  
All the wealth in the world  
could not cash that check you wrote   
so long ago–set her free.   
For she weighs on you  
as much as you weigh on her. 

I've seen in the space of a breath  
two melding autumn waters, her pupils  
dilate and remind me of rapids at night.   
I saw eternity there. Her head tilts.   
My brain floods with serotonin to recall.   
Idiot plot romance where every syllable   
is profound, and she is a stream  
you can hear and not see.   
And you are dying of thirst. 

the only thing I hope me and John Lennon have in common is getting shot

murdered by gunshot wound and having a Japanese wife as insane as she is attractive

if She made me believe in Divinity  
the Healthcare System is Diablo  
if there were ever such a thing as an Angel  
and God knows I've had a few trapped  
in cages I've devised, over the years…   
Then This Psychiatrist Is Going To Hell



I'm going to start making a tally  
for every sleight against my person.   
Its location will be my forearms,   
so whenever anyone asks me   
“What the fuck?” \-  In regards to scars.   
I'll be able to point. “Here,  
“see that blood red tally across  
“the other four inflamed lines down?   
“That one is yours.” Yet. Still.   
Those unconscionable fucks  
still won't understand that  
my split blood  
was the least painful part involved  
in that little mark of a scar of the countless  
that'll scale out from my arms   
and spill like stars in the sky  
over the canvas that is my skin. 



naked and wet and blood running down my arm  
my hair – long and ashen now was dripping too  
was it always so orange   i take my brush  
the person looking back at me in that vanity  
huh. i can not recognize my face again.   
opting out of brush I take oversized scrunchy 

i feel nothing

thinking  
impatient for my own wake  
perhaps I should make more incisions  
ill toil with that a bit in the back of my head  
as I lay eyes closed  
my pillow is soaked – feels the same   
as a lack of identity. chilling.  
my bed will have to absorb some more red  
I blink wondering turning  
how many of my funeral rites   
might be honored or not  
or who would even go  
no… it doesn't  matter to me either

To the Women who kept me out of their hearts;  
your feelings about me, then, were right.  
I couldn’t take the burden nor light  
of an inner sanctum such as the kinds   
I unknowingly sought in yours,  
not until I had one for myself.

Live by the sword, die by the sword  
is my whole existence. I just live by word;  
and I might well die by it — so when I say  
I ought to mark my skin with scars   
like how stars gather in the sky.  
You should take these things  
with proverbial grains of salt.

They say live by the sword, you’ll die by it  
but few willingly face that rightful death.  
I choose to live by my word;  
and I certainly won’t route.

Men can only be measured in their spirit and worth   
by amounts of blood spilt.   
They live by the sword, they die by that sword.   
Women might only live and die and be valued by  
the only thing they may always hold true,   
God as witness, their word. 

Men can only be measured In worth  
By   
Spilt blood   
Women only live and  
Die   
And be valued by  
The one thing they know   
Their word
