## Values
From [[8 - Writing Projects/New Alaska Mythos, Hollis Notes\|New Alaska Mythos, Hollis Notes]]

1\. Intuition
    1\. Instead of logic, they value being able to sense the direction of things. Gut instinct. 

2\. Imagination 
    1\. Basically being a visionary.  
    2\. Being able to come up with novel solutions out of whole cloth.

3\. Belonging
    1\. Your place in the universe.  
    2\. What you want to do with your life. No wrong answer, E.G. I want to be a vagabond.

4\. Mysticism/Spirituality
    1\. Value spirituality over material possession.   
    2\. With enough mysticism, miracles can happen. Miracles come in flavors of the gods.  
    3\. Belief in legends / folklore. 
    4\. \*\*They believe in something like a Ragnarok, and believe one has happened already\*\* (which made the ‚Äòmiracles‚Äô that happen today possible).  
    5\. \*\*Believing in the Gods and Praying to God is a core value in society. If you don‚Äôt you‚Äôre believed to be missing something core.\*\* 

5\. Transcendence 
    1\. With enough spirit you can gain god-like powers. (What powers??)
    2\. Trying to gain something intangible made material, like a gift. Knowledge you shouldn‚Äôt know counts, too.  Or, you could meditate and wake to a silver prosthetic hand in your lap. This hand would operate, essentially, on magic. A miracle. 


## Plot Overview


## Chapter 1 Outline

### DRAFT 1.00
1a - 1c: Introduction is ‚Äòeveryday,‚Äô then ‚Äòone day‚Äô combined.  
Approximately 4,000 words total. No more than 7,000.

1A. Everyday‚Ä¶ You see the character wake up. They slept like a baby. There is a man half asleep, half naked, on a cat-clawed recliner in the corner. He says, ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt know how you managed to sleep tonight.‚Äô ‚Äî because today is the big day. Essentially the start or end of your life, depending on how things go. ‚ÄòI can sleep under any condition ‚Äî it‚Äôs one of my finer qualities.‚Äô And she smiles. She is at peace with today. ‚ÄòJust can‚Äôt wait to be shot at,‚Äô apparently. And she means it. She‚Äôll feel better once she‚Äôs holding a rifle. She gets up, wraps a blanket around her and shuffles over onto his lap. Now the cat‚Äôs not the one purring, but her.


### DRAFT 1.70/PLOT
### a1
**RULE 1: LOVE YOUR MAIN CHARACTER TO DEATH AND BACK**
<font color="#953734">a1-a2</font>

**<font color="#953734">a1:</font> watch the end of the world**

1. this is simple. it‚Äôs just a pretty story of the world ending with your lover. Two nukes go off. It is shown it‚Äôs basically the world of Dredd, except everyone with a gun is their own Judge and the actual Judges are the worse villain's of them all, corrupt to the core.


**Your mother dies. You become holy, where there was green there is golden light in your eyes. You are mantling into Godhood. In this same instance, some supernatural effect shakes the earth and a God is manifested:**

From [[6 - Main Notes/World Building _ LORE from OneNote\|World Building _ LORE from OneNote]]
>the universe, now in existence yet empty, created a Mother to birth itself---so that it may experience all that it has. The Mother, often called All-Mother, started backwards---she created many ways that life may itself give life in a begotten never ending cycle. In making everything there is, the Mother had to make ways that it may return to nothing where it came. ~~It is not known why it must return to nothing---but it must,~~ so she birthed the first Gods.  
>
>The God's were jealous so they broke themselves into many parts in an attempt to make one just as perfect as her image. The remnants, the failures, still plague the stars to this day.  
>


- Your mother is the monster. You must kill her‚Äîno one else can.
- There are two of your mother now. The imperfect God and the Fallen Angel (failed god manifest) who grows more and more by the minute.
	- The Fallen Angel is sort of like Pan.
	- You can calm her with your music, which was once hers.
	- Kind of accidentally taken from FFX(?)


She takes the soul of Brand at the end of the Chapter. He dies in body and lives on spiritually as a medium she can use to move around with in The Web (name???)

Another person gives their life for her in the next chapter.


### b3-b4

**<font color="#7030a0">Outline:</font>**
**b3**
1. Brand is now a spirit that can be controlled when she‚Äôs got her eyes closed (at least for now)
	1. Brand is going to corrupt her and kill her. His essence is volatile, he is now going to turn her ruthless and violent with time and her body will ‚Äúfragment‚Äù and her memory turn into something like dementia. 
	2. ‚ÄúTHERE IS SOME CONTOUR OF A POLYHEDRAN BOTH CORDED AND SOLID BLINDING AND DEFENING THAT SEEPS INTO HER, EACH POINT OF CONTACT ITS OWN RIVER TO WHIRLPOOL LEADING INTO A STAGNANT WATER.‚Äù
2. (who is likely to have information on this?)
	1. Freaking out, what would be in character for her to do:
		1. Drink.
		2. Look at herself in the mirror. Dissociation: she can‚Äôt tell it‚Äôs her face.
		3. **She prays. Show her praying before this, that it‚Äôs a normal thing to do.**
			1. ‚ÄúTELL ME WHAT TO DO, GODDESS‚Äù and there is an answer. ‚ÄúFIND X-family-member.‚Äù 
			2. You have a huge influential family that you disavowed. 
			3. The eldest, that‚Äôs what you call Augury even though he has a twin sister, Piety. 
3. Someone in the family sacrificed or was sacrificed for a terrorist attack.
	1. The ultimate question is‚Ä¶ who, and which? And the eldest has the answer, wherever he is‚Ä¶ seems like he‚Äôs dead or severally wounded (teleported)
	2. elite overproduction. the story ends in you becoming God of Arcadia. 




b4
1. She is possessed by Godhood. She does things despite herself. But she is still herself at this point. Her goal at this time is to figure out how to save her life as she knows it.
	1. There is a plague. It‚Äôs turning people into spirits of pack animals that are‚Ä¶ disturbing. Like in strawberry shortfuse. Monsters seem to manifest out of nowhere.
	2. she is immune to disease. If she does X, they‚Äôll extract him into a machine (ghost in the machine) but she will never be the same.
	3. This is her reason to fight‚Äîinitially, at least.

















Shiks`

Something like how the shiks are suppose to always carry a weapon and bangle etc this society has similar rules. 

As well as inspiration from their culture.
