You're best at writing the kind of story Jammey Inflames is... Real life, near modern day, just with a twist. Not fantasy world or shit that don't exist and never will. Things grounded. 

Is writing fiction five minutes into the future. Specifically your not great at fantasy worlds or creations which could never exist... Be pragmatic. Make everything something you have personal experience in and not just that but things you have strong feelings about and can speak at at length... Don't make shit up out of whole cloth, make shit up already grounded in reality. 


## Summary


## Research List




## Template \\ OG Inspiration.

‚ÄúElliot Oblivion, Chapter 01.1‚Äù
	"Day" only starts when the sun has turned its torturous attention sufficiently enough to different continents. 
	I had moved to Anchorage to escape the 200 degree day heat of California, but in 2073 all of North America worships the two moons, new and old, rock and artificial. 
	"Night" starts the day for every-man. We crawl out of our borrows sank in microscopic dirt one step away from sand and get to the work‚Äîperhaps that‚Äôs the wrong word. Perpetual hustle. ‚ÄúWork‚Äù implies a certain amount of respect. 
	Respect had died a long time ago. If it ever existed. In its place was something angsty solipsism, a zeitgeist on individual success with no cost too high‚Äînothing is taboo. There‚Äôs no such thing as friends. 
	There‚Äôs no respect, but there is fear. It seems like life has become a living catch-22 where you‚Äôre only options are bad and worse, where you can only pick the lesser evil. 
	Right now fear was knocking at my door, turning the knob, and approaching with the distinct clack of stilettos. 
	She threw a vanilla envelope onto my desk, knocking aside several empty cans. 
	‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got a case.‚Äù 
	I consider myself lucky. 




# SET & SETTING
## WORLD
### Two Moons


**57 years in the future,  on a supernatural planet earth‚Ä¶**

This world is where you don‚Äôt need superpowers to perform inhuman feats. It is 57 years in the future on Earth. Inexplicably, there are supernatural elements added that came about only a generation ago for unknown reasons. Some people are so powerful as a mere mortal, they seem like they're mutated. Maybe they have?

Most of humanity now lives underground, and is nocturnal. There was a second, artificial moon put in the sky to reflect more moonlight, which it does well enough. So, there are now two moons. One the rock, the other an artifact. 

**`Supernatural`**

The World Listens

- If you neglect what needs respect,  
- if you wrong another severely enough,   
- extreme communal unrest,   
- and the purposeful creation of these. 

  These things will invoke the powers of the world and bring about by way of supernatural manifestation righteous retribution, even if some innocent people are killed in the process‚Äîthe world might say it needed to crack eggs to make an omelet.


The Power of Word

- If you break a promise,  
- or if you invoke a vow and break that.
	- marriage is very serious, and there are multiple kinds of marriage 
	- there are many kinds of social contracts, friendships included
	- it is not traditional to be done for average stuff, like everyday trades. though, in a huge capitalistic merger it could be that there are lifes on the line.



#### Jammey Inflames, originally(?)
1. Humans are nocturnal because it‚Äôs so hot. Wake up and use UV lights for awhile first thing in the morning.
2. Two moons. There is a second, artificial moon in the sky and it keeps the ground more than lit enough to walk to work by.
3. Guns have almost been eradicated. Combustion engines are all but outlawed.  
4. Mythical creatures and monsters exist, though they are indeed mythical and aren‚Äôt often seen.  
5. All magical things are of the supernatural nature. No ‚ÄúI cast fireball\!‚Äù It's more like, ‚ÄúI pray for help, any help\!‚Äù And the attacker combusts into fire as if a fireball came down on them.  
6. Aurora is pretty consistent, showing up most nights.  
7. Your in Alaska. Long days, short nights or vise versa ‚Äî but global warming has made it more or less summer-warm year round.  
8. ~~Always talk of Greenland. Shit is always going down there, not here, like politics that happen in America but affect a battleground in the middle east.~~  
9. DENALI in the backdrop.


**Science is Magic** if you ever want to add fantasy, just devise a way technology works indistinguishable from magic.

### SOCIETY

### Values:

1. Intuition
	1. Instead of logic, they value being able to sense the direction of things. Gut instinct. 
2. Imagination 
	1. Basically being a visionary.  
	2. Being able to come up with novel solutions out of whole cloth.
3. Belonging
	1. Your place in the universe.  
	2. What you want to do with your life. No wrong answer, E.G. I want to be a vagabond.
4. Mysticism/Spirituality
	1. Value spirituality over material possession.   
	2. With enough mysticism, miracles can happen. Miracles come in flavors of the gods.  
	3. Belief in legends / folklore. 
	4. **They believe in something like a Ragnarok, and believe one has happened already** (which made the ‚Äòmiracles‚Äô that happen today possible).  
	5. **Believing in the Gods and Praying to God is a core value in society. If you don‚Äôt you‚Äôre believed to be missing something core.** 
5. Transcendence 
	1. With enough spirit you can gain god-like powers. (What powers??)
	2. Trying to gain something intangible made material, like a gift. Knowledge you shouldn‚Äôt know counts, too.  Or, you could meditate and wake to a silver prosthetic hand in your lap. This hand would operate, essentially, on magic. A miracle. 



## RELIGION

Of the Cult:
### Fire & Blood (from Every Thing Made of Fire)
**Flame** is sacred. Flame is the ultimate cleanse. The natural state of all things is to become part of the dust it was borne of. We are all huge collections of it‚Äîand put under flame, we return to it in the form of ash. Ash is symbolic of that‚Äîash is part of the larger dust, dust will feed the trees. Become part of the ground. To nourish new life, to become food that will be consumed, to nourish and fuel and return again. Dust and ash is the start and end. When you start fire, always consider that you are not too different from the flame that warms you. And that you too will become ash, someday. Surrender to it.

**Blood** is sacred. Blood needs cleansing. Blood is the ultimate payment. Blood belongs in its place. To spill blood is wrong because you brought it out of its rightful belonging. Nothing is right or wrong. But if you spill blood, you are unclean. Light flame and surrender yourself to Above.

Of **good and evil** and right and wrong \- these are fabrications. We Below put attributes to things as good or right and wrong and evil because it is easier than whatever the truth is. Everybody can redeem themselves‚Äîit‚Äôs just that sometimes to redeem will take longer than you have left to live.

Everything has a **belonging** \- you are not able to change what is not in your Providence. No matter how hard you might try. The only thing you are given absolute agency over is your own self. It would pay you dividends to think about the boundaries of what makes you up. And then to stay within them. That is the control over your belonging. You would be wise to remember that of everything that belongs to you, you need little of it. And of what you need, you don‚Äôt need control of often.

**Providence** is fate, and rarely destiny, decreed by those Above. Fate is inevitable. Destiny is when you were given choices, but that you were forced to choose. 

**Boundaries** are sacred. They are your own providence, or as close to divine will as a human can come to. When a boundary is broken, the breaker is unclean and must be kept away for the remainder of the year‚Äîor as much as is possible. Hold suspicion for the person who would knowingly break a boundary. Always tell the person that they have broken it, and in plain English.


## Creation Myth
### The Age of Myth:  
   
Since the universe could exist it only became a matter of time before it did. It is said that if this universe is to end that that same beginning would necessitate itself once more, and it has been theorized that this exact thing has occurred many times already.  
   
So the universe, now in existence yet empty, created a Mother to birth itself---so that it may experience all that it has. The Mother, often called All-Mother, started backwards---she created many ways that life may itself give life in a begotten never ending cycle. In making everything there is, the Mother had to make ways that it may return to nothing where it came. It is not known why it must return to nothing---but it must, so she birthed the first Gods.  
   
Because of it now existing with form, it necessitates that is also does not. There is a mirror of the universe, identical in all ways---but not. If it exists, that means there must also be the space for it. The mirror is that space. There may be more than one of these mirrors that we are hereto unaware of. They exist independently---but not. Why everything that happens here also happens there---why it acts like a mirror---is unknown. There is no reason why the mirror of our universe, the single one we do know for truth, wouldn't itself have a mirror as well. It may be that the more mirrors down, the more mirrors that are necessitated in a multiplicity. Mirror theorists spectate that four mirrors of mirrors down this line that it no longer acts like the sake of its name and thus mark that boundary as chaos.  
What is already known  
(work up to this point?)  
There are "Gods," and there are demi-gods. And not only that, but theoretically anyone can "mantle" themselves into godhood, as well.  
 

### **The Monarchy:**
It is said that after all things were birthed by the All-Mother at the start of all things, after all the gods she made to sow death in her cycles of life, she gave birth to one last thing with the last of her strength: herself.

But the All-Mother never had corporeal form. Even if she existed, even if she was birthed, she was made, fundamentally, of the same thing an "idea" constitutes. Ethereality. She had made all that existed and then she became the rules, the laws, of which there is no escape, but under which all is fair-game.

She also became what we might call "spirit," or otherwise any other sixth sense, named now in more professional circles "extra perception."

Many things are still unexplained. We still have many theories that we assume for truth, but are in essence unverifiable. She is that. She is the glue that combines together any thing that any one might refer to as "gestalt." 

Observation of our own mirror suggests that the law of entropy as defined in thermodynamics has direct correlation to a mirrors position in this series. Since entropy exists in our own world it is universally agreed that we are, ourselves, a mirror---though, any definition of that position is heavily contested, and remains as a great point of contention in even the most irrelevant of subjects.  



## CULTURE
Something like how the shiks are suppose to always carry a weapon and bangle etc this society has similar rules. 

Southern Politeness (!?)



## AESTHETIC
Drugs, Sex, Music, Fashion
	*SOUTHERN INFLUENCED*
 
  1. What drugs?  
	  1. Psychedelics, mainly. Booze, as always. Though, it‚Äôs looked down upon to do too much drinking. 
	  2. Pharmaceuticals are prevalent though most of them have ways to rid yourself of their effects like Naltrexon does today.  
  2. How sexual? To what extent?  
    1. Chasity highly valued in women and men both. Being polite and kind, too. But knowing when to bite back is just as admired. 
    2. Men, their temperance first and capacity for violence second. This is a world where you can assault someone ‚Äî as long as you have a justifiable reason. 

  3. What kind of music?
	  1. The kind with not many vocals. EDM Jazz. The beat sounds like it‚Äôs going so many steps up then the same amount of steps back down.
	  2. The counter culture is something that matches leather jackets.

  4. What is the relationship between these?  
    1.   
  5. How do they feed into each other? Why?  

  6. Fashion:
	  1. 


## CHARACTERS
### Example
**Ex. from Jammey Infames**
>*James/Jammey ‚ÄúDexicode‚Äù Monikel* ‚Äî Modeled after myself. Is transgender. Has demons, and PTSD, and sleep paralysis demons ‚Äî and ‚Äúsome sort of mood disorder.‚Äù Phobia of dark skies. Sometimes she doesn‚Äôt take her meds.   
>Traits: Obsessive. Intense. Type-A. Often highly escalating‚Äîshoot first, ask questions never. Then shoot again. Addicted to pharmaceuticals. Makes them, too. Or, once did.

**Breakdown**
James in [[‚úçÔ∏èWRITING/New Alaska/FROM GDOCS/Jammey Inflames - Idea, Notes, Etc\|Jammey Inflames - Idea, Notes, Etc]] is: 
>A graphic designer that is laying low because their main job, involving having a background as a lawyer, was to make a drug in a think-tank to see if they could control culture would work‚Ä¶ which it did. 
>1. *Background as lawyer*
>2. *Worked at Think Tank*
	1. Created a culture-changing drug there that infected popular culture.
	2. Got heat.
>1. Thus, became *graphic designer.*
>   
>They moved from California, their home, to Alaska ‚Äî where her long time love was born. They moved there together. She is trans, has that same love mentioned that she‚Äôs still madly in love with. He has a kid who she still considers her own. They can‚Äôt be together because they were in a open relationship and he knocked up his ex-gf in what was probably a baby-trap.
>

Your character needs to be this complex.


### **Hollis Van der Berg** - Brooklyn
*Make it based on a mythical figures story.* 

#### Take 1
Background
>Hollis was gifted divinely with an eye of death when she was born‚Ä¶ She has epiphanies about some people she meets, not in her control. Some about what their death will entail and even how long they have to live, sometimes how. Her background is in teaching to gain divinity like herself, a teacher in essence.


Childhood
>she may be holy, but her parents ain't. 
>her father is ex gang tied. Her mother might be more scary than him. They divorced but still work together in politics after taking a stack of cash and getting into real estate. Big into it, too. 

Her young adult background
>might be holy, devoted to the church, but devoted as much to gang shit and teasing the bad boys she's with. Adheres to being a virgin until marriage. All good girls follow this as rule with a few exceptions. 


>She is burnt out. At work, teaching, she gains insight that she wishes she didn't have. The divine gift is a curse. Knowing the death of others is a burden, and when she sees a young girl has a cancer that leaves her a dead man walking, she pukes. She leaves work early. 
>
>Her heart is broken as it is, the bartender says. Boys. It breaks every two months. Has no kindness left, which hurts her deeply. Orders the strong stuff. 
>
>Sees someone, her eye of death reveals info to her. 

What she wants and can't have:
>Love. A place to call home. She doesn't belong, she doesn‚Äôt know her calling which is highly prized in her culture‚Ä¶ even though she does good to teach others a valuable skill. 
>
>the man she sees with her death eye, she gains divine knowledge that it's her soul mate. He dies at tomorrow's dawn. 
>
>there is *X* mythical thing he is hunting. He will not stop, even with knowledge he'll die. He says, "you, divine one. You know best of miracles unexpectedness."
>	"For someone graced you forget miracles are often more a curse than blessing."


#### Take 2



**Hollis Van der Berg** - Brooklyn
Already holy, lucky, but maybe shouldn‚Äôt be. Parties a bit too much. Loves way too much. Heart breaks every two months.

~~*Her profession:* 
If Brooklyn is so "holy" then maybe she is a "priest" of this world? 
What would a priest do in this world? 

~~What she needs slash wants:~~
~~Character flaw:~~

Your character has to
1. They‚Äôre so impressive that they could have their own Wiki article.


What would I possibly do that would put me on the map? Or Brooklyn?


### The Foe turned Foil:

from the north, with northern values. Logical, not gutical like the south is. Calculating, in a word. **Erik.** 

They have some trouble understanding each other because of this. 



## PLOT
Notes on Writing a Novel by Tim Rogers
>Chapter 1:   
 In chapter one, we meet the main character. We experience the main character‚Äôs ‚Äúevery day‚Äù and ‚Äúone day‚Äù in that one chapter.¬†I like to combine ‚Äúevery day‚Äù and ‚Äúone day‚Äù \[in the first chapter\]  
 In my opinion, the best way to do this is to start the story cold with the main character doing their job. I want to immediately frustrate my character. From the instant I introduce the character to the reader, I am itching to point the character at something that is different, and see them react to its being different. 
 Then, when the ‚Äúevery day‚Äù becomes the ‚Äúone day‚Äù, the transition is enormous and jarring even to our extraordinary character. 
 Chapter one is around 3,000 or 4,000 words. Chapter one is a short story. It absolutely must work taken on its own. 



Day (Question): 1A,  ‚Äî 2C,  
			      3d, ‚Äî 4f,   
				      5G,  ‚Äî 6I
					  g5, h5  ‚Äî i6
			     D3, E3 ‚Äî 4F,
Night (Answer):  a1, b1 ‚Äî c2 

*Each chapter is written by one of the characters.*



### THE QUESTION
What experience do you want this to be about that you've been through, and what experience in your life would you like to explore?

1. The beauty and spirit of the south. It has to be drenched in that first and foremost.
2. About a culture I want to see now in a worst case scenario future of run away global warming and a US government that's president is well understood to be a hereditary dictatorship. 
	> What happens when there's too many elites? 
3. Fuck that though. I want there to be a short story. 5,000 words or less motherfucker. Start thinking, what's a world with a problem you can have fun with and also conclude in 15 minutes of reading? 
	>What is your job? 
	>And is it delivery woman? 
	>	*The story is about your profession.*
4. 

Like snow crash: 
Chapter one involves two characters that end up in conflict but ultimately help each other.


Idea:
Needs to be a figure that correlates to dissociation. 





Stop writing about possibilities of the world and start thinking of things impacting it at the very start of the story.



## OTHER
**Option 1: On The Job**
**Pro:**
>How Tim Rogers does it‚Ä¶ Though I‚Äôve never read a novel by him.
>


**Option 2: Already God-like**
**Pro:** 
>is like Roger Zelazny would do‚Ä¶ he is my favorite writer!
>


**Answer:**
A mix of both.



## Alpha Drafts
### Try 1 
Part 001
She entered the bar in all her bone chilling glory. It was the eye that looked like the pupil was a cross in the middle of iris like midnight waves.

‚ÄúThis drinks on me, get the good hooch!‚Äù

The crowded bar buzzed, uncertain. The bartender, a man that looked like a dumpling with buckteeth, broke the uncertain feeling in the air. He hollered, ‚Äúa toast, thank you young lass!‚Äù And a round of applause emitted from him like a stone dropping in a still pond.

There was good reason to be uncertain and the inhabitants of the little bar knew the why, it was that same little woman buying a round. 
She wasn‚Äôt old enough to drink. 
Even yet, she strutted up like a lioness to that same bucktooth bartender all grins, her arms raised as if in victory.

‚ÄúThis better be good, young one.‚Äù
‚ÄúFor what, Claude? On a night like this, how much better can it get?‚Äù
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not even noon.‚Äù
