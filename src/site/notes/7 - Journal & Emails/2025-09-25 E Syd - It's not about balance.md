Well I’m unemployed still so basically things are instantly not very good right off the bat. 

There are some thoughts I want to write out to you about alcohol. You see—I go without it, and these strange things happen. It’s some what like a mental assault. I don’t understand how it works, but it happens about a week into sobriety. You’d think, oh so your sober when you wake up and these things happen? No. 

What it is… is probably one of those internal states you feel and cannot describe. Language is made to try to convey ideas. I can’t do that here. This is the best I can do: it’s like your getting haunted but the ghosts are your memories. And then, alcohol is the numbing agent. But it numbs everything. It dulls everything. I’m not as sharp, I’m not as creative, I’m… dull, life is duller, everything down to color is less vivid. 

To confuse matters, the ghosts are not usually memories but the feeling of the memory that lives in your body. So it’s sort of like getting electrocuted, it’s a feeling or emotion, you aren’t watching a movie if that makes sense. These feelings bubble up in the absence of alcohol. Now we’re having a magnitude problem. The intensity of the feelings are almost enough to make you want to curl up on the spot. And then their gone. In that sense, it’s  like anxiety or a panic attack. When will it come next? Why did it come at all? Will this just happen?

I’ve been confused until now. Why do I turn back to the bottle when I have so much to gain when I’m dry? And it’s that. That happens, and that’s all I need to convince me heart and soul that I’d rather drink a few beers a day than deal with whatever fucking specter is waging a war against my soul. And… I’m absolutely chemically hooked on alcohol, and it’s a habit too. So little encouragement is actually needed. But that’s a lot of encouragement once I get to that point where old feelings of trauma attack me.

Obviously, I need to face my demons. That’s the right thing to do. And I don’t even have an answer to not besides that I just don’t want to. I know I could in the right conditions, I don’t even see why this is the wrong one, but that’s a lot of fucking effort because god knows I got a lot of undead and demons waiting to bite into me.
