## The Virtues
1. **Love (Agape)** 
	- Agape is a type of love that means absolutely unconditional love, specifically love too.
	- All other ethics flow from this. This is the most important and to be practiced above all
	- *You used agape love to heal yourself when you were without-self.*
 
2. Compassion
	- Feel deeply for others. Do not just feel empathy, think of how others feel intellectually. Try to understand their pain from their eyes, in their skin. Always practice that sympathy and never judge others.

- Humility
	- Jesus washed his disciples feet. He was not above anyone else, though of course he was.

	- Defending the poor and oppressed.
- Courage
	- Walked knowingly towards death, which is represented as doing the right thing *under the right circumstance* even if you know it’ll kill you.
