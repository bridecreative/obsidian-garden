## The Virtues
1. **Love (Agape)** 
	- Agape is a type of love that means absolutely unconditional love, specifically love too.
	- All other ethics flow from this. This is the most important and to be practiced above all
	- *You used agape love to heal yourself when you were without-self.*
 
2. Compassion
	- Feel deeply for others. Do not just feel empathy, think of how others feel intellectually. Try to understand their pain from their eyes, in their skin. Always practice that sympathy and never judge others.

- Humility
	- Jesus washed his disciples feet. He was not above anyone else, though of course he was.

- Justice
	- Defending the poor and oppressed.
- Courage
	- Walked knowingly towards death, which is represented as doing the right thing *under the right circumstance* even if you know it’ll kill you.
- Forgiveness
- Faith
- Practical Wisdom
- Peace



- **Compassion → Justice**  
    His care for the suffering gave his pursuit of fairness _heart_, making justice not cold law but healing restoration.
- **Humility → Courage**  
    Because he was not ruled by pride, he could face danger and humiliation without fear — his courage was not about ego, but about truth.
- **Love → Sacrifice**  
    His willingness to give his life was only meaningful because it sprang from boundless love; sacrifice without love is just loss.
- **Wisdom → Peace**  
    His insight into the human heart allowed him to offer reconciliation instead of escalating conflict — wisdom channeling peace.
- **Forgiveness → Hope**  
    By forgiving even the gravest wrongs, he kept the door open to new life and change — forgiveness as the seed of hope.
- **Faithfulness (to God) → Strength**  
    Trusting in God’s will gave him the endurance to suffer and persist; his inner strength flowed from his fidelity.
