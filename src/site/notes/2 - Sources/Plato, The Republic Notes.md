## Inspiration for Religion:

~~What I know of the book is that it’s actually what Christianity is based off of.~~ 
I heard this book was the proto-alpha for what would become the Bible. 
	Which… seems impossible, but about 8 pages in there is an annotation on the page (not in the back) pointing out ‘in a startling prediction of christian ethics.’

Not only can I see where Christianity got ideas, I can also see where Norse Mythology does. 

## Initial thoughts going in
1. Instead of a numbered list of philosophical meditations this seems to be written as if a novel. 
2. The main character (so far) is Plato’s master, Socrates. From his odd first person view (it feels as if it’s in the third person until it, again, says ‘I said’) 
	1. Probably because it often doesn't mention Socrates thoughts on a thing, his talking is his thoughts which is pretty inline with Socratic dialogue. 
3. We are given a dialogue, a back and forth conversation of various people Socrates encounters that instead of a list that feels like an eighth grader wrote it we are given what a ‘perfect republic’ might look like.
	1. Show, don’t tell, basically. 
	2. There are many layers. If you take it at literal face value you walk away with little. There are implications underneath it all, multiple ones.
		1. This is what the beginning preface says. I'm not sure I see this personally yet. Or I'm otherwise overlooking something. 

*I predict* the point, by the end, is that the perfect republic is itself obviously imperfect in ways.  

Republic is about envisioning a perfect community/society. It is not about a literal republic. 


Chapter 3:
- When individuals find they cannot do everything by themselves they group up. 
	- This is fundamental on a level extremely understated. Humans need each other for many reasons. 


Plato means broad in Greek. His nickname was so well known we don’t even know his real name, it’s a myth by now.

## Lessons

### Specialization
Plato seems to think that the best citizen is actually one that is focus on doing his absolute best on his one profession he does for a living. A blacksmith should not also be a carpenter, they should alone be a blacksmith and focus on it and master that. 
	Funny enough, Cady just touched on this. He said, it use to be that our lives fed into our professions not that our professions were eating into our lives.
		This is a amazing bonus of what Plato suggests.


## Censorship 
Next, It is agreed that after all the people who are needed to sustain one community that soldiers are now needed to protect them. Socrates suggest there should be a best, most ethical way, to make these soldier. 

It is infinitely fascinating to me that Plato see’s censorship as not only OK, which he proves in the first page talking about it, but rather it’s necessary. 
	Makes you think of today: would Donald Trump have even won this election if not for misinformation? If it was obvious to Plato, how could we not possibly see the damage of blatant lies in our news, poisoning the mind of the masses? Crimes are immoral and lying on the news is clearly immoral.


A great deal of time is spent on what should be censored for when these soldiers are growing to adults, but how is generally agreed to be the entertainment, at that time poets and playwrites were entertainment. Poets were also often cited as sources of information at that time, what a poet wrote could often become knowledge for a population. So as to make the best soldier possible, they decide first on what has to be cut. 
	in a weird twist, they describe that instead of just censuring Hell (Hades), they also say how it should instead be described in place of what’s taken away.
		They settle that for making the best soldier Hades should not be a horrible place to go but rather it should be honorable for a soldier to die and go there so they are not afraid of dying in battle. They even say that the names of places in Hades should be changed, like from River of Hatred to something else. 
			*Like the Vikings are described.* Eerily so.
