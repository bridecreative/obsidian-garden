- HORATIO — cool as name

- Drama looks like quick switches between emotions often. Happiness between friends, then bad news that causes deep sadness. 
	- Drama is sometimes simply in the wording. Adding a metaphor of how *EX she is an angel…* can add, it’s so extreme. it’s not, I love her so much, it’s calling her to divinity. 
- Drama is extremes, mostly. That is, fundementally, a “dramatic shift.” These shifts can happen in the same sentence, even. And probably should.

- the actor has feminine traits. quick to weep, but righteously. *for a reason, in this case his fathers death.*

- this play uses modern props. This is cooler than using swords and shit. *This odd 90% modern 10% old school mix is rule of cool.* 
	- The ghost in the story is basically a ghost in the machine. it works perfectly, somehow.
- the effects are pretty modest, really. 

- calls upon god in language often even though these guys were definitely vikings. so Shakespeare was making historical fiction then the play made the fiction modern, as well.

**STORY**
- father dies, story pivots upon.
	- Mother is in incestuous affair with uncle immediately after his death.
- ghosts are real. they lampshade this immediately. “there are things not in your books,” or something. Like, ghosts you will not be taught about.

- his fathers ghosts tells him how he was assassinated by poison. 
	- FUCKING LOSES IT ABOUT THIS AND SWEARS SECRETARY 
		- They swear, they are his best friends it seems.
		- a shitload of quotes come from this scene.
		- some improve seems to be done.

- we are constantly reminded of the fucked up incest relationship. 
	- after all, this the whole reason for everything. nothing would happen really if not for this.
	- his mom is intoxicated about this all and it disgusts the audience as well as everyone else. *SHE ISN’T BEING TRICKED, it seems.*
		- They are warned how fucking pissed the son is. Basically, he is a danger. And the son, hamlet, writes them a passionate letter of how fucking mad he is about what he knows but is secret
- *all of this means they make a plan to keep him far away.* which works but only to a certain extent.

- **note:** actors don’t move too much even when that could be dramatic. humans need to memorize lines or move around, probably.
- hamlet starts to go all out on everyone but known friends. he is smart to, too, though that’s his instinct which impresses the audience. 
	- hamlet even sees through the seeing through of other actors helping the bad actors. it’s impressive, and his bold telling that he knows it is all the better for his character. 
	- *SHOOT FIRST PERSONIFIED* 

- **STOPPED ALMOST EXACTLY AN HOUR IN AS HE IS BEING SENT AWAY.**
