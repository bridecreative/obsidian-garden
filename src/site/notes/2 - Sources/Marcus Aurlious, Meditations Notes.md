Meditations:

Book IV:

3\. Why do you fret? Remember the doctrine that all rational beings are created for one another; that tolerance is part of justice; and that men are not intentional evil doers. Think of the conflicts that are now vanished with the dust and ashes of the men who knew them; and fret no more.

…

Chaos cannot touch your soul, only stare outside of it to cause disquite. Then, disquiet can only come from you yourself, not the chaos itself. Only your reaction can shake you \[you have complete control over yourself, including your reaction to even the most horrible situation\]. 

Change is a constant. You’ve already experienced so much through your life, you will only experience more because the whole universe is in constant flux of changes. *Life itself is what you deem it.* Life is opinion \[and everyone has an opinion\].
