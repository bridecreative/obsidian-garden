First born—  
Well, it depends on how you define birth.   
First born of that batch of children my mother churned out.   
Mind you, there’s no father.   
Third best with a weapon. That’s for sure.   
When I see—visually—I understand.   
Comes with being a god—  
Well, half god.   
I won’t gale you with my life story. Some things are better left to the imagination.   
Getting my hands dirty for mother dearest…   
Call me Beatrice. That’s what everyone else calls me, anyway.   
I suppose you could also call me Pallas. That’s a worn nickname.   
Went out of fashion when I got older and meaner. 

Dirt so fine it threatens to be called sand. It was just missing that distinct yellow. 

Characters:   
Beatrice can understand on sight. It’s one side of being a god. She has a raven that follows her, occasionally gashing into her flesh. It acts as a sort of limiter.   
Corvus, her raven companion.

Nine Levels. Based on Paradiso. 14th century logic. 

Moon: Optics. Illusion. 

Mercury: Bright. Self interest. 

Sitting on a rock again, waiting for the sun once more. The moon hung over the horizon, threatening to fall off the world. Maybe I’ll get lucky and it will.   
Something like a raven flaps and flutters onto my shoulder. “Nevermore” I say. Oh, it is a raven. Just overgrown, tinted red with my blood from the past century. I had no imagination when I named him.   
I clearly hear my own reedy voice. It’s echoing in my head, like a gong being repeatedly hit. I begin to see colors that shouldn’t be there. The bird gashs its beak into my shoulder, chipping bone, sending a shock of sense back into me…   
I’m looking down now. Dirt so fine as to threaten to be sand. That’s most of the America’s now. You need ungodly amounts of ammonia to get anything out of the dirt. It was only missing the distinct yellow. I mused, if you put that fine, worthless carbon under a microscope you’d see it’s actually silica. I smile, waiting for the bone to heal.  
One hand automatically makes its way into a pouch under my gambeson, pulling out some dried white and lightish green leaves, stems mixed in. I pinch and rub the stuff before putting it in my mouth and chewing. A stimulant. Addictive, of course. Not that it matters to me.   
In theory, not much should matter to me—yet here I am.  
Getting my hands dirty for mother dearest…  
“Beatrice,” the raven croaks out. I feel it’s talons dig into me.  
I reach under my right shoulder, drawing my spear into my left hand. Its familiar weight reassures me more. It has a special name—it is rather unique. Remind me to gale you with that story another time.   
The tip of the spear makes an arc through the dirt, deep and meaningful. A perfect circle, with a meter radius, once I’m done.   
It always starts with a circle.  
Once the arcs connect—  
You’re tracing. Tracing out an ankh. Dirt shifts under your feet, moving toward the pattern you create, lifting the dirt inches off the ground. Lines shift by themselves. Looks not unlike a celtic knot with beads, now. Whatever your body is doing, it’s automatic, tantric.   
You can feel your blood vessels tighten as your jaw clenches down on the bitter leaves. The very ground rumbles in recognition. As it subsides, you rise, and the dirt rises with you, as tall as you are.   
A sagebrush started to wilt in the foreground. The rock you were sitting on just a moment ago—it cracked in half, reducing itself to rubble. Heat. Even here you could feel a scorch. Nevermore clucked, fluffing its wings uneasily.   
Out of the pillar of dirt came
