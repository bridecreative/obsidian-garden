>Do not speak on others behalf with me again please. That's my boundary. If you've a bone to pick with me, fine. Speak your mind. Not others. Leave other people out of it. Me and mom treated each other badly over the years. You were not there for it. Even if you weren't across the country, you are neither me nor mom. She is fully capable of defending herself. I have forgiven her. She has forgiven me. It is absurd that you exhume what is dead and buried in the name of someone else. I don't believe it for a second. You've got the shovel in hand wearing all black at night. You're dredging this up for yourself. If mom were dead I might tolerate it. Last I checked she is not. Stop it. What do you have against me? What did I do to you? I'm being sincere. Whatever it was. It wasn't fucking worth it. I'll get on my knees and beg the next time I see you if that's what you need of me. I'll do like with the old gods and kiss the bottom of your feet. I feel your animosity even now. All the way from Tennessee. 


First of all,  
And you shall see  
The quest is get my   
Sister back to me.  
Let's drop our pretty shit,  
Like soldiers dropping their   
Weapons. I'm done fighting,  
I'm doneâ€”period.  
Crucify me. If that's what you still want  
I'll gladly carry that cross.   
All I want is my wise beyond her years  
Her *most dramatic* yet silly self  
The woman who protected me   
As a kid, who's crucified herself   
A few times for others sake.   
Gives good advice.  
Always keeps a cool head.  
I. Want. That. Back.

I do not hold an olive branch  
This is deploying a bombardment  
Of roses. There will be love.  
Or there will be nothing.
