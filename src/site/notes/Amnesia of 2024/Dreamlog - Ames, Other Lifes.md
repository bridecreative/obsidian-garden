[[Amnesia of 2024/Dreamlog, Totality\|Dreamlog, Totality]] #Poetry 


This was the first dream I wrote down. It isâ€¦ one of my favorite things I have ever written, easily. I woke up and wrote this more or less as you see. I altered it a bit later, and this is the product. Whatever the condition I wrote this in, I love it.

Dreams became things that haunt me after this.



 (First dream I wrote down. From OneNote. Marks the start of several dreams and trend in being a wholly different identity completely foreign to me.)
>I've been having nightmares fueled by PTSD demons shoveling coal into the furnaces of my worst imaginations. Then I will lay there awake. Scared to sleep, for I will go back to the dream. But I will drift, I will dream again, but it will be of a life I never lived. If I were ever a teenage girl with teenage friends, if I were trying to have a fun time and harmlessly flirt on a never ending summer day... Attempting to play Dance Dance Revolution at the small town arcade with a dress on. How do you do that, you ask? I'll have you know my modesty remained completely intact for that minitured lifetime. I went up to my most favorite of the boys who'd been following us around and asked for his sweatshirt, so I may tie it around my waist. It was beyond bliss. I kept seeing faces out of the corner of my eyes. I proved to them the initials AMS at the top of the leader board were none other than mine. As the sun went down and we walked in haze so perfect it could only be dream, doom kept at it inevitable encroach like how waves turn rock to sand. There was danger around every corner. I never wanted it to end.

>Kenzie got arrested for selling drugs and I was asleep when he left. I awoke on this precipice, a ledge. There was a high railing guarding a lawn then some side walk way down. Two kids from my school who were always greasy were stuffing each other into barrels so tight it was inhuman. They had shit eating grins. They tried to talk to me like they were court jesters and I acted like their poverty was infecteous. I needed to help Kenzie. Then I was getting a ride home but kept falling asleep. I asked to stop somewhere for food. I make friends with this old man behind the counter and we talk about the probability of dice rolls but I keep falling asleep over and over and he keeps putting blankets over me. I always said I have a ride out front in protest. *Then I slept for a final time and I was in a fantasy world as a woman warrior like out of Conan the barbarian. I had children. I knew what it felt like have your own kids, and to protect them, what it was to love them and to love another. And then when I was considering everything I live for I woke up and I had none of it.*
