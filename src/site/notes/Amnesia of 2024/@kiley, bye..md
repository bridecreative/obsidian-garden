[[Amnesia of 2024/2023 12 December\|2023 12 December]]

November 30th I created this document. So says Google Docs. 


This was… the singularity that started it all. If I hadn’t sent this… I don’t know what kind of person I’d be now. I really don’t. 

The problem is probably that I wrote this with the lucidity of Stephen King. It’s so visceral that when I read it just now, it was a bit of a shock to my own self. I can’t imagine being Kiley and getting this. She wouldn’t be able to get over it… which makes sense why she would then push back on me moving here. Though, I don’t forgive her for it.



>You were going to say you're setting boundaries, right? This last call, you started to say that. Kiley. You called me to break my boundary. I said I didn't want to talk about your misandry. Yet you called me to speak about it. To try to admonish me and defend yourself—under the guise of a friendly chat. You set yourself on fire to keep me warm? Kiley. If I'd known that I would have told you to not do that. I don't think that makes me any kind of saint. Anyone would. I'm not even a little upset that you botched that conversation with me. I think it's perfectly understandable, even if it was frustrating at the time. It was an extremely sensitive topic. Anyone would be nervous. But you called me to try and tell me how difficult that was on you… on you? When most people make a mistake they say sorry so both people can move on. I feel like I am lecturing a child. You sounded manipulative. You were hurt by your inability to be sympathetic—what does somebody say to that? It's just a question of if you intended to be or not. The way you describe my “intensity” is like if someone said “you're too true to yourself and your values.” Oh? I started writing because I felt I had no voice. You're saying you hear me too well? I'll gladly be “intense,” then. I hope this is intense. Just because you read too deeply into “I hope you get help” isn't my problem, anyway. It's only that. Reading into it. Next time you should ask for clarification and not assume. I know what I wrote Kiley. I write from my heart. You just read it. My main source of help is prayer. Walks in nature. And writing. I'd recommend those. Therapy is for deeply rooted trauma that you're ready to spend years of work on.   
I told someone I consider as a brother to go away because he's racist. I know him as well as I ever knew you. That was just days ago. He said something similar. “I'm not racist, I love black people\! It's just that most blacks are rapists and murderers.” That's racism. When you say “I wouldn't put rape past our dad, he is a male.” That's called misandry. I don't care if you don't understand this. This is not my hill to die on. That is why I said to not talk to me about it.   
I guess it's just one of those weeks. And I was so happy I was finally connecting with my sister. But she was actually giving herself third degree burns just to talk to me about poetry and Shakespeare. I've spent most of my life trying to stand you, Kiley. Now I want to love you. Finally. I'm not gonna let some stupid petty argument that I simply don't want to talk about get in the way. I hope to see you again one day when you're ready to respect that and want to love me too.
