[[Amnesia of 2024/2024 3 March\|2024 3 March]]

All I can say now 8-5 is this is when I started to cut. Here is that months poetry [[✍WRITING/👩‍🎤Poetry/April 2024 - Death March Ends, April is Healing\|April 2024 - Death March Ends, April is Healing]]

I put it in the title of it, it’s that important. What I can also say is that—of the six months total where my mind shattered, I still struggle to comprehend that it was four months in when I started (cutting). Because I look in the mirror, and it intuitively feels like that must be six months worth of self inflicted pain. Not two. 

And that it was seeing that psychiatrist that was the final straw. That’s what pushed me over the edge. Of all the things. Thinking I’d be taken off my carefully balanced medicine regimen. I think I used those exact words back then too. I didn’t do that on purpose just now. Weird.
