EVIL
1. Mom says that there isn't enough money for food so she buys the worst shit in the world but this doesn't makessense because if true she couldn't have even fed herself before I moved here or otherwise never left the house, never bought a thing besides food, or only barely had enough to feed herself.
	1. She buys me specifically plenty of food, it's not even cheap, it's just the worst most trans fat shit in the world when before now she was going out of her way to buy me healthy food because I was working out. 
		1. For herself, she still eats only organic vegetables and its the stuff from Kroger. 
		2. All other food she buys that isn't already the store brand stuff we usually but isn't the cheaper brands as well. I just checked. Organic sugar is twice the price and she bought a four pound bag. The BBQ sauceiis the good stuff we usually get. 
		3. She hasn't gone to cheaper alternatives, she just buys the food only I eat garbage. 
	2. If I calculated the total amount she spent per week before I quit and after I can say with certainty what she buys before and after is close to the same and I think there's an argument the worst food she is buying is actually more expensive due to being more tasty due to insanely large amounts of preservatives and fats. 
	3. Says that she can't afford the better coffee but the better coffee is about $2 more and she knows I fucking hate the store brand coffee and I know she doesn't care about the taste of store brand. 
2. Still buys the same amount of alcohol. This is the nail in the coffin to me. Alcohol is expensive. 
3. Is baiting out how far she can push boundaries. Indisputable at this point. 
4. Is extremely cold always and oftenshort tempered since I quit. Indisputable. 
5. The angry asf silent treatment is a common fixture here now at the drop of a hat. 
6. I had to turn off texts from my mom due to how inflammatory she is over text message. 
	1. I have cut twice because of my mom triggering the shit out of me this past month. They were both over text, the last time leading me to the above resolution.
