## Rule 0:
All manipulation preys on humans innate want to believe and trust others. Even perfect strangers. It all builds on top of this.

This is a obvious need. If you don't trust others your inclined to distrust everyone. Society cannot work if we all innately doubt each other before we speak a single word. 


## Rule 1: Level 1: Foundation
### Confrontation
Given direct pushback, most people will give ground — generally speaking. With direct confrontation of something, you almost necessarily force the other to back down. People do not like force because of Rule 0. They want to trust you.

# Pre-gaslight: Plausible Deniability
Let’s say, your ex boyfriend texts you and asks if your able to talk late at night. You still care for him, maybe you shouldn’t, so when you wake up you ask him “what’s up?”

He says: “It was about X but I found someone to talk to in the end. Besides, **if I talked to you I’d want to hold you…**”

You give condolences, you even say it’s always okay to call in the middle of the night, your very kind but because he said he wanted to hold you so **you remind him that you’re not interested in sex.** 

**He proceeds to go off on you about assuming it was about sex.**


What is the problem?


He is using plausible deniability to tell you what he obvious meant didn’t mean what you know it did. He didn’t explicitly say by holding you that you guys might have sex—but it didn’t need to be said. You aren’t 16 anymore, if you hold your ex lover in your arms, one you still have some feelings for, one thing *will* lead to another. Besides, even if that wasn’t true, the way he phrased it explicitly implied that by holding you… something else would follow… it’s in the ellipses. 

But because he didn’t say it outright he has wiggle room to turn it on you… Even though it didn’t need to be said explicitly—it was implicit. *You assumed, this is on you. He is sick and tired of you always assuming that it’s about sex.* Even though you’re right, it is about sex this time and it might often be about sex when you guys reach out. 

Rule 0 and Rule 1: Level 1: is heavily relied on here. He is taking advantage that you **want** to believe him because we inherently want to believe others, especially when directly and forcefully confronted like that.


## Gaslight
Plausible deniability is a word trick. He is trying to say that this word didn’t mean what you thought. If this happens often enough, it fucks with your head a bit. It gets to you. Gaslighting is not exactly a step above, it’s more like a flight of stairs up, but it’s similar. What you said didn’t mean what it meant. Even though—you’re right, their just twisting your words. This isn’t twisting the words, this is telling you the words were never said at all. That it’s your imagination, or you misremembered, or you’ve had this conversation before, or that it’s anything but what you actually know it to be. And because you want to trust them, you believe them. This will almost instantly make you feel like you’re losing your mind because this isn’t a twist, a gaslight means that you 1. You have a false memory. 2. Their full of shit. 

**A gaslight is an entire fabrication.





## Rule 1: Level 2: Connect Four
This is somewhat difficult to explain, though we have all probably done this at some point it hopefully doesn’t happen enough to you that you have a name for it. And furthermore, Level 1 above takes no tact at all. Anyone can accuse someone of assuming something or telling them something didn’t or did happen. 

Basically, this is leading someone in a conversation. And it isn’t necessarily bad all the time. For example, you can use it to deescalate a situation. But you can also lead someone to a response they didn’t mean or even want to be in.

I call this connect four because it’s like leading people into the spot you want them to go. Your baiting them into the response you want. This could look like leading them into starting a conversation they said they were done talking about. Then, they feel like they started it, not you. But you knew it would lead to this. Then, perhaps, they try to drop it. But you put pressure on them by being forceful and confrontational by saying, no, you brought it up again when you said you wanted to drop it you can’t just drop it again when I do want to talk about it. And maybe you’re angry now and you know their gonna get heated too so there is no way they’ll drop it now. Then you drop your voice but they don’t drop theirs and they seem like the bad, angry party. You bring this up later.

You just had them break their own boundary, and they don’t realize it so it’s deceitful, and I think of both deceit and breaking boundaries as de facto manipulative. You just won this round of Connect Four.
