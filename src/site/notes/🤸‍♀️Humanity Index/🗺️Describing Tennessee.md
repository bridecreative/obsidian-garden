# THE MEAT OF IT

>Oregon forever changed me, Syd. I bundle up for 32 degrees and I gotta take off a layer by the time I walk five minutes. It was 42 out and my mom picked me up in a sweatshirt, she was shivering a bit but in that “oohhh, I’m starting the car!” way. But that was a 20 minute trip, not running out to start the car. Just yesterday I sat in 36 degrees with my coat wide open and I felt great, talking to a coworker while they smoked. The trees are naked and I don’t need to check my weather app ever - not ever - to see if it’s snowing in the next three days. A foot of snow? Kiss my ass. If that ever happens it’s only because it’s the end of the world, anyways.

>I love it here so much.

>I could cry right now.

>I found my place and belonging. I’m a woman and Tennessee is my home. I wanna make it better. I wanna help people around me grow in the same way I tend to my garden. I want this house to be a safe space for people like me to be themselves, even if it’s for a moment only. This is not a friendly place for transgenders. I’m extremely lucky, extremely. Three people killed themselves in the first two months I was here. It made me want to tear my hair out, and now I try not to look. I’m gonna make estrogen pills. Oddly enough, estrogen isn’t scheduled and thus it’s completely legal to create for yourself. Chemistry is still the wild west, in general terms. In America, all they care about is that the pills in your bag aren’t illegal. That’s it. 


>It’s really cool here because in Oregon at least Fall arrives in three days. It’s 80 and lush green and everything is alive, it rains the next day, the day after that trees are red and it’s 60, the day after that it’s 50 and it stays there until winter decides to come which is always on its own schedule. I don’t like 50 like that. I need more than a sweatshirt in 50, but every girl there says “oh, sweater weather!” But only because the only time they are outside is from where they are to their car. Here, fall has come on so gradually it seems like **how people would write about it in fiction**—it’s too perfect, picturesque. Summer is lingering like few times I can think of in my life, with Autumn coming down on us like how the moon does eventually take over the sun. I love it here. 
>
>**I describe it like the same materials I had back home but used in such a way that it seems more foreign than fantasy and science fiction I write.** I’m guessing there’s lots of places in the world that feel foreign like that, but I’m enchanted like I’ve never heard someone report from travel somewhere. *Even the moon has a different feel. That gets me everytime. All sorts of things do, little things too, like how the maple leafs are sort of spikey looking and not just several points.* Never occured to me they could be like that. That still gets me too for some reason. **Now everything is changing color, but I almost didn’t expect it to.** There’s so many bugs here it makes camping from where I did in Oregon seem like nothing. *It’s so lush and green and full of life, I didn’t expect them to be able to wither till naked like trees do back home.* I couldn’t think of the humidity leaving. Everyone warned me about the humidity, Syd. It’s humid there! I kind of like it. Yeah, I said it. I think 0% dry desert sucks, that’s too dry. My skin feels better here. My hair hates it though. Hopefully that gets better with time.


>I still find new things to love here. **Yesterday I felt like I was in some sort of battlefield, and people appeared here keeping one thing from where they were taken from. They build on top, and on top, and on top for hundreds of years never starting new but somehow it all made some sort of cohesion, everything disparate and stolen from some other place that melted together and somehow made neighborhoods, just like the world where I came from!** *Because this place hasn’t just abducted me, it’s also stolen my heart. I feel good here, I feel right. God is good. He brought me to where I always belonged.*

First Paragraph:
>If I didn’t know better I’d say outside the borders of Tennessee is an ocean and this place an isolated island. I’d say, people were abducted here through magical portals hundred of years ago from a hundred different worlds and they all mixed in this melting pot that was never taken over by one kind of peoples but all of it weaved into the land itself, the culture the same as when they came because the world itself determines what will be. They're all revolutionary, they're all divided three ways and they like it like that and everyone has the warrior gene that doesn’t hesitate or flinch at blood. Women are as much men as any man here if not stronger. But there's still harmony, and they still unite and they all give it their all for what they believe in which is unsaid but felt viscerally. 

From 7/25/25
>How you can literally touch the power lines here and they aren't even pointing straight up their just in whatever condition their in no matience done in over words ***this place is don't fix it if it ain't broke.***  
>
>There is jungle on one side of road under a canapoy of trees and the other side is developed city with brick houses


>I feel like I stepped into an old world. It’s like when you see pictures of Europe and it’s got a bunch of different architecture and the sky is different somehow, the grass a different color than yours. This is so much that, but stranger. It feels like you stepped onto a battlefield. This is if it ain’t broke don’t fix it on steroids. There is a downtown that got abandoned due to the highway going into the town going further down the same road, and it’s especially strange because it’s coming back. There are derelict residential houses with asphalt parking lots where there should be grass, renovated ones here and there where people live next to a bar and tattoo shop one vertical house down that are still the original 80 year old framings. Then you go two miles or less down the road and there's a new downtown but even there there are some abandoned buildings dotting what you’d expect to be more brick and mortar locations. The kicker is the battlefield part. This is, no shit, where confederate soldiers absolutely came through to buy supplies, this town's old name being “Muletown.” Well, you could buy more than mules here. You could buy slaves. This isn’t even hidden, I read this on a lil popout cardboard infographic in the library. They celebrate it’s old name, but it’s old name is filled with the fact that the only reason this town exists at all is because it was a convenient spot in between other towns to buy — cattle. Humans are included in that. 
>
>To get back — a battlefield. It’s the sweeping of the ground, how you can see how people could creep up hills, hide between the rolls to shoot. How you can imagine a cannon being in that field of grass or an ambush in the canopy of trees. Then there are clear spots with not a tree. Doesn’t look like there was ever a tree in these fields. You can almost see bodies on the ground, swords stuck in the ground. There’s old graveyards out of some movie you can’t pin, but you’ve seen something like it before, maybe in a dream. A lot of this feels like the city planners were ghosts and memories. There aren’t blocks here, if you tell someone you live four blocks away they don’t know what that is — that’s because there aren’t more than four sidewalks I’ve seen of, but also because the blocks are more like vertical rectangles, and the rectangles sort of form some sort of circle. The town is dense, far denser than any city in Oregon I’ve ever been in. 


This places sky reminds me of Nagrand in WoW

# Combined

People park in the grass and nothing is symmetrical. It's not blocks, the locals don't even know what the fuck a block is. It's more like vertical slices and in total the city makes a sort of circle.... I don't know if Ive seen a block like in Oregon. Once. 

I cannot imagine this summer jungle dying. 

People here have layers. But the first layer is always an ego or country humble. 

Someone said there aren't cowboys here. I haven't verified this. 

Of rednecks: fruity compares to CO. Have under glow and lifted fronts.

## Southern Culture

Either / Aither 

Friends will say "your momma gonna worry / be mad" and sincerely mean it, as in your mom cares about your own personal decisions - not that they only care about something you did that affects them like it means to me. 


When a southern girl is thrown some bullshit she doesn't entertain it, she doesn't shut it down, she'll do some tongue and check 'oh sweetheart'

## Driving here
People don't know how to drive around you on the street. People don't know how to drive, generally. 

People turn in their bright slash flash them when they see you at night presumably bc of how unusual it is to see someone walking at night.
