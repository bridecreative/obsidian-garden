Before, we conclude that **there are inherent things all humans want out of life. They want to love, create, and nurture, and have purpose** (meaning). Without these things your life is not whole and will feel various degrees of empty. 

In combination these create [[2 - Sources/Eudaimonia - Wikipedia\|Eudaimonia - Wikipedia]] or otherwise known as “flourishing” to the Ancient Greeks.

**My philosophy predicates on this:** you do not search for a way to get happiness for the day but to make towards long term flourishing, however that is. 

This is most commonly seen as… trying to fill all these checkboxes. 


Happiness is achievable but it is (somewhat) counterintuitive. There may be some things needed, or at least helpful, to finding these things in your life.
1. Something greater than you (religion)
2. Taking reliance off science in your personal life and looking towards philosophy as an answer to “big questions”

Here is an example. Your brain releasing the correct amount of chemicals and generally functioning properly is directly proportionate to how you are doing.
	This is bullshit.
The more power you take back and into your own hands is proportional to how happy you will be. 
	what you do when you leave it to science like that is that you give up your agency in the process. There is now nothing you can do.
		Now, there is nothing you can do but rely on the science and someone elses authority on that science to get better.
This will make you fucking miserable. You have just given complete control of your life to science and the authority of the person that went to school for that science, a psychiatrist or therapist or such.


In the long term, you will always be better off taking as much of that authority and power back into your own hands. you have first hand experience of this.


Most humans do well when they have answers to the big questions.
1. Where do we come from
	1. And why are we here (see, that pops up again)
2. Where are we going
3. How does it all end

Men especially will find comfort in these answers. Men are sort of created to be unsatisfied with a single answer, often turning over stones even once they do have a solid foundation for all this, to see… what’s underneath that rock?
	This makes logical sense. If you aren’t always looking around, seeking answers, evolutionary you become uncurious. Human progress stagnates. 



I am now a woman. I am perfectly happy with a life where I have a significant other as my purpose and having meaningful children with my loved one. Turning over stones, something I did all my life, is no longer something I’m extremely curious in. I know what I want. It’s that. I feel many women feel the same way, that simply living life everyday is itself meaningful.
