# Alcoholism 

## REASONS TO STAY SOBER
1. YOUR VOICE NATURALLY DRIFTS TO WHAT YOU WANT.
	1. THIS CAN’T BE UNDERSTATED.
2. God will give you the strength, drinking is a fear. Embrace the fear. Trust, and surrender to God.
	1. (AA much?)
3. You're more creative! 
	1. Writing is your thing!!
4. You're smarter — WOAH
5. People like you more! 
	1. Seriously, you’re weird when you drink.
6. You have support!! Brooklyn!
7. Less dissociation — ALMOST NONE
8. If that isn't already enough you should drink. 

## WARNING SIGNS
### Sometime in November or so…
I knew, apparently, around November when I broke up with Frankie and started hanging out with Brook that I was deep in an addiction.

from my notebook:
I am, literally, an alcoholic. 
actually, really.
Just keep that in mind,
not that’ll do you any good.
(I write next, in bold underline with an arrow pointing up)
		One beer trip later...
			<u>TRUUU</u>^^^


## Factors
1. Trauma. A lot of it, too.
2. Genetics. Mother, at the least, drinks too much. Father “recovering alcoholic” for 30 years. 
	1. Some doubt. Neither seem to be *true alcoholics.*
	2. They likely are alcoholics for the same reason you are.


# Mushrooms
**SELL TOUCH** fake shrooms — they do give euphoria…
