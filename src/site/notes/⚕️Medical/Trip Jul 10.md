What does immortality look like in scifi

- And who kills those immortals?  
- What does the world look like  
- Think blood meridan evil to be able to   
  exterminate an immortal, it’s its own type of killing

There are so many long running and fundamental problems with my perception and even the way I think about my perception cognitively that I am unsure where to even begin 

That being said. I didn't know that previous to this trip. Now I can begin to address the issue. 

***NOTES** the next day all transcripted from what I texted Syd and the memories I still have of last night.*

- My core issue isn’t the parts, the parts and alters are the *solution*. They are only helpful. They are quick dry concrete for your soul, holding it together. Embrace them, they love you.  
  - James is reception. They are more helpful than you think. Bless them.  
  - August is like if your dad was perfect and had no anger issues, a true brute force genius. Embrace them. Let them come in more often.  
- You felt how deeply hurt you were on your walk, you are so deeply fissured down to your core. Eventually, that core of you was blocked off because simply to be near it was saddening.  
- I felt I knew I was a woman *externally* and this was important. Whether internally I should be is up to me.   
  - When I thought of lowering my dose, this was essentially outright rejected. It wasn’t an option, because I do like the effects of estrogen right now.   
  - If I like these effects and I tell myself I can’t lower the dose, I am going to look like a woman sooner rather than later.  
- \[of that my person has been deeply shattered\] “I didn’t need to reflect at all it’s self evident and that I haven’r come to this \[realization\] yet is proof of my own inborn self sabotage.”  
- “I am a forest infested with rot and bugs more made of fungus and parasite than anything alive. I am begging to be burnt down to make way for more lush pastor, for new life to grow. But the forest? It’s been petrified to stone. I do not know how to light it anymore.”

- TRIGGER WARNING child abuse the following not 1:1 what I said to Syd  
- “I think I was more abused as a child than my mother will admit.”  
- “I think that’s been a shadow following me as long as I’ve lived. It’s crept into every faucet of my life and tinged me in its horrible shame and hideiousy.”  
  - I saw when my conscience came to me and admitted to me the acts, I felt what happened to that child because something inside me remembered the imprint and they were more severe than what I’ve felt in my body before this, those feelings almost only in dreams.   
  - Some things come to me as very significant all at once.  
- “She was complicit I think and I think that explains some things I’ve found odd.” I go on to say that her being such a hands off parent with me but not my sisters seems to be pathological.  
  - “She had to tell herself since I was a babe when I was abused to dissociate from it, she had to convince herself in a traumatic way that it wasn’t her place to help me, she had to convince herself the abuse of me was beyond her but that she’d do what she could for me besides.”  
    - (THIS SOUNDS FAMILIAR)  
  - “Even though it went against everything she stood for.” She will always say to me, I loved your dad for twenty years. This seems to me now, after his backstabbing and sabotage like she is still in his abuse.  
  - “Even to both our determent \[to this day\] she said I’d do what I can but I have no direct control… over my baby.” “When she was the only one that did and she knows that all too well.”  
  - “It’s not that she is my friend, Syd. It’s that she still is traumatized. She still thinks… I can’t be close to you, my own child.” “Because if she is close to me she is just as hurt as I am from the abuse.” “And… I am shattered from the pain of it.”

- How do I not feel that my body is a womans? It is so obvious, just look at myself in the mirror. I’m not even “barely half way,” and I don’t understand how I don’t understand that.  
- How is it possible to even confuse how I feel about myself? Even in my thinking I am more woman now than man. More of me is woman than male at this point, but I cannot even grasp that? Something blocks me from the step of acceptance.   
  - (Note: this morning I feel my body more, and it is very much womanly feeling now\!)  
- Sydney I am in a fight with myself  
  - At this point during the trip, I was talking directly to my trauma. One thing that stuck out *even during the trip* was that the trauma was omnipresent. It was my own internal voice. It was everywhere, I didn’t need to look in a direction.  
- What happened is the trauma told me how to set the mood. This included exactly what color to set my light, and how dark it should be. So I set it to a dim dark blue. It said turn off the music. Then it said, try not to close your eyes while we talk, you can blink of course (rather understanding for a personification of trauma.)  
  - When I forgot and I closed my eyes, my subconscious came and ripped away the entire conversation mid sentence and I remember curling up as the past and present was torn from me. I couldn’t remember what happened, the conversation, just the outlines of it, the fading image.  
  - The trauma wasn’t “setting the mood.” It knew this would happen. It was trying to keep me as undistracted as possible, it saw this coming.   
  - Before I realized it was my trauma, I was talking to something that seemed innocuous. It gave me “personhood,” it said. And I felt like the area above my forehead expanded mentally. Some restriction was lifted. I knew this was good, whatever it unlocked.  
    - I asked it something and it said, I think it was talking over my question, you need to remember: I didn’t give that to you. I was the one that took it away.  
    - I asked its name then and it mused, “anti-matter.” Ever present, everywhere, but invisible and the opposite of our light? It was omniscient, that’s fitting enough.

- I tell Syd that I realize I never had a strong identity to begin with. The foundation  and framework I am trying to use, in short, never existed. “This is a tired thing to hear in the trans community,” which is very true.  
- “I was a person with tastes and sense and feelings of course but the definitions of an identity? I never had that.” And I wouldn’t know, how could you tell the absence of something like that.  
  - You can not know what you do not know.   
- My mind is my own worst enemy “no wonder I type everything out Syd\!” My own mind is liable to take it away from me otherwise. And can no longer keep thoughts like a normal human, nothing in my mind is exclusively mine.  
  - At this point I think my subconscious comes in again to delete what’s going on in my brain. Just tears it away again.  
- I realize how I speak to the other parts of me, how I pathologize information into memory internally. And I realize at this time the actual looming thing I’ve been missing. Jan to May — which I call the period of spilt blood.   
  - Since then, I’ve been so damaged. What I thought of was actually Disco Elysium. How different parts of his brain speak to him as if they are not a part of him.   
  - So how I pathologize information into myself, the language I use internally, is making me think of experiences and events as not something that happened to me. Subtly.   
- “That's the elephant in the room. I don't need to ask or wonder. That's the crater around which my world is still trying to build out of.”  
- “I cannot understand this, my brain is against me.” I really cannot understate it.


***GOALS***

- I need someone who will call me once a week on the same day, even preferably around the same time. Even if it’s only 30 minutes.   
  - I NEED MORE CONSTANTS AND STRUCTURE LIKE THAT, that’s the point. Also, human interaction would help. As I say “I live in a world of defamiliarization. I need an anchor.” Well said.  
- I need to do an exercise everyday, even if it’s as simple as doing hand eye coordination. The goal being, be more aware of my body. I am more than my mind, I’m not sure if I… know that. Or I forget.  
- “I need to work on the most basic foundations as if I were a child learning the structure of the world.” Expound on this. How?  
- IMMEDIATE GOAL: Who do I want to be as a person? Not where do I want to be in five years. But for the foreseeable future, and this can change, *who do I want to be perceived as?*  
- Define the time period of the time of spilt blood, even if it’s just a timeline right now. Just get down the events, at the very least.
