# Iran, Or Where WWIII Begins

They hate America more than anything and at any cost will defy them. Britain and America installed a brutal police state monarchy when they got a deal they didn't like. On paper, they doesn't seem to threatening, but they are an extremely powerful people. 

1. Oil rich
2. **Controls the X straight** 
3. . 


Alliances 
GOAL: Remain independent of American Influence
Axis: Hamas, Hezbolla. 


## How Iran Wins
1. Moral / Division 
	1. But they fucking hate America way more than any internal problem. 
2. Isreal Palestine War Optics
3. Weaken the enemey
4. Bring in Russia and China
	1. To distract and weaken opps. Has to be done right
This will all be done slowly. 


# Asymmetrical Warfare



# Drone Warfare




# Empire, Or Why Baby Boomers will End Us

#Politics/Geostrategy 

- HUBRIS
	- Stubborn
	- Over confident 
	- Inflexible 
	- No creativity (imagination)
Example: Vietnam. Americans refused to adapt and be creative like the opps, so the opps out thought them to victory



# Isolationism

Dominate powers in place of America will be:
Germany for EU
Isreal for Middle-east
Japan for Asia

America's raw power is suppressing these three currently. 

Over extension
Debt
Civil unrest (war)

We are on the way to all three. And oddly, even if America collapses it doesn't mean it isn't threatening. It is. And it could take... LITERALLY CENTURIES. It could also be relatively quick, but empires donâ€™t often crumble overnight, especially the biggest one to ever exist.
