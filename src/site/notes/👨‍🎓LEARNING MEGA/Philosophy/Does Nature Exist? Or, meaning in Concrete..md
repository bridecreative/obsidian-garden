For a long, long time if you felt like you didn’t have direction you could, theortically, romantically, take off your rope sandles and find some forest, which was realistically a stone throws away from your house, and dig your feet itn othe ground. You’d find some quite spot in the woods, maybe next to a stream. Then you’d assume the position of ‘the thinker.’ Everything else would follow. There was guidance, there. All you must do is listen to nature long enough and nature will tell you what to do.




1. Don’t be with “nature”
	1. Does nature still exist?
	2. Is there truth in my world? “What is… Trump. Final answer.”
2. Where once there was guidance in simple existence, existing is itself chaotic. 
3. “Be in the rightness”
	1. In the modern era, generally—esp. when there is no one truth, you must find your own.
	2. Thus, following the truth of another is to become a solider for them.
